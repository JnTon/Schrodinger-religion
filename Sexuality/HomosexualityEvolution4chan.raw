Evolution is not intelligent design. It's just a series of accidents. Homosexuality is probably one of those accidents. Thankfully humans no longer rely on survival of the fittest to survive so a potentially bad accident like homosexuality or autism won't be weened out by survival of the fittest. 
Of course, I have no specific evidence to back this up, it's just my theory. 
This video gives an explanation of how evolution is crappy and kind of illustrates my point. https://youtu.be/P1Y9tG48Vos [Embed]

Non-breeding males are a benefit to a family unit and better the chances of family offspring surviving. For 99.9% of human history women have been largely useless. They had a go being useful a few decades back but went back to being useless. Men are needed to hunt, grow food, protect women, etc.a non-breeding male would provide these services and increase the likelihood of female survival without fighting with the alpha breeding male. 

Imagine if you had an alpha male and he had 10 breeding females. Males from elsewhere would try and usurp the male and breed with those females. A non-breeding male doubles the protection of those females without competing with the alpha.

Basically gay men evolved to be slaves for straight males. We should serve straight males and be a source for them to release their sexual tension while their women are with child.

namely the act of copulation without any possible reproductive outcome, and here is where biology fails to explain it.

because that energy expenditure invested in that act is not really entering in the equation

Fitness = Reproduction x Survival

if you want a more wide and completely unrelated definition of what homosexuality is probably you should read the gender theories of Kinsey.

Oh not at all.
With Bonobo's we have a very good biological explanation why they have so much "useless not reproductive" sex.
because it creates and supports bonds between group members.
Which actually means it's anything but useless.

But what it is you haven't told yet.
Because people don't know what exactly it is.
They don't know where to look for it, and thus they can't asnwer why it's there.

Which is why evolution or anything else for that matter cannot explain the existence of homosexuality.

No there must be theories that at least try to explain it

higher group bonding, higher survival chance as a group, is a pretty good explanation.

All we have are some nature/nurture debates, with the ocasional tinfoil tocoplasma gondii coming along, but that's where it ends.

We have no idea what causes homosexual behavior in some and not in others.
We don't know what to look for, we don't know where to look for it, and without these answers we cannot explain the existence of homosexuality.

One thing that people fail to understand is that homosexuals who want children will find a way to have them. In the past, being homosexual has only been mildly against evolution, because gay men would have relations with women and have sex with men behind thier backs. Today, gay couples with those men who want children, and previously would have had them with a woman, tend to adopt. So if there are genetic predispositions to homosexuality (I believe it's a combination of predisposition and early experiences that shape sexuality.) then currently homosexual traits are being systematically destroyed through an accepting culture and too many undeserving people who make children and put them up for adoption and gays taking the should be abortions into thier own homes.

Having sex behind someones back requires cunning and being emotionally manipulative to certain people. Strong traits for "survival of the fittest" especially in capitalist society.

There aren't any, which is the point.
All we have are a bunch of studies with twins that show that there's a certain likelyhood that if one twin is homosexual the other might be too, some brain scans that show that certain parts of the homosexual brain show some slight similarity to straight female brains, some theories about brothers hormones and the womb, and some about toxoplasma gondii.

That's it.
if there were an answer it'd be in the news everywhere, aln with the unavoidable debate of whether aborting potentially gay babies would be the morally right thing to do.

You just made a big soup.
No sources.

adoption doesn't increase the homosexual male fitness, and is a huge altruistic effort to lower the biological preconception of rising your own genes in favor of the "specie".

Cheating is a well studied behavior and increases the heterozygosity (H) factor in the offspring in monogamous pairs.
Here again has not much to do with the homosexual behavior.

If you mean that an homosexuality in a population to survive needs to cheat, I would absolutely disagree with it.

Did you actually use your brain for this one?
On the assumption(!) that homosexual behavior has its root in genetics(!), more specifically a homozygote recessive combination, then the continued existence of homosexuality as a very small minority in a general population could be explained with the Hardy-Weinberg principle.

Since you already ditched that idea before even looking at it, you should realise that the other ideas aren't gonna satisfy you either.

Which is why I said at the beginning that the theory of evolution or anything else for that matter cannot explain homosexuality.

Lot of reductionism ITT...the fact is, there are multiple plausible explanations, some of which are supported by specific evidence. I'm not going to look up any papers, but you can probably find exactly what substantiates each hypothesis by typing a few search terms into Google Scholar.

The most plausible idea, in my opinion, is the idea that homosexual gays offer some benefit to their family members, which is substantiated by findings that the female relatives of homosexual men tend to have larger families.

There are also findings that successive offspring increase the odds of an individual being gay or transgender, 

>>7251949 (You)
You'll have to be more specific than that as you're not giving enough information to suggest a specific paper (or to suggest that you're looking for a specific paper), and the idea of 'explaining homosexuality from an evolutionary point of view' isn't well defined.
Do you mean that the paper argued that homosexuality had a reproductive benefit?

This implies that homosexuals and bisexuals share a common ground.

Yet as far as my understanding bisexuals are in vast minority than full homosexuals.

Homosexuals aren't incapable of having sex with women. Many homosexual men have children with women. Sex doesn't require sexual attraction. Very few gay men are physically incapable of having sex with a woman. Those who claim they can't probably would under certain societal pressures that have been in place in the past. I'm a gay man and I've had sex with women.

>The Darwinian paradox of male homosexuality in humans is examined, i.e. if male homosexuality has a genetic
component and homosexuals reproduce less than heterosexuals, then why is this trait maintained in the
population? In a sample of 98 homosexual and 100 heterosexual men and their relatives (a total of over 4600
individuals), we found that female maternal relatives of homosexuals have higher fecundity than female
maternal relatives of heterosexuals and that this difference is not found in female paternal relatives. The
study confirms previous reports, in particular that homosexuals have more maternal than paternal male
homosexual relatives, that homosexual males are more often later-born than first-born and that they have
more older brothers than older sisters. We discuss the findings and their implications for current research on
male homosexuality.

Humans have larger testicles than other primates because we are not monogamous. Men's penis head flares so it can scrape out rivals sperm. Breeding females ovulate monthly similar to non-monogamous animals. Monogamy was invented because beta males were causing too much civil unrest when they weren't breeding.

Some much more than others. 

This is interesting, I wonder if there is correlation between how adept a penis is at pulling cum out of vaginas (how large and how flared a man's penis head is) and other traits like agressiveness or hypersexuality. And if these corralative traits would persist together through a long monogamous era.
