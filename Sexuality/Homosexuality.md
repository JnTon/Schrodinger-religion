# Homosexuality

## Gender dynamism
I think we need to start to listen to the Tumblr girls. 
Sexual orientation and gender can be dynamic.

## Occurrences of homosexuality in other kingdoms
Homosexuality is one of the apparent paradox of the Theory of Evolution.
Homosexual behavior exists in nature, many species do show same sex behavior. 
There are many hypothesis both adaptive and not that might explain the paradox. [1]
There is an underlying theoretic genetic model that might explain a evolutionary advantage of same sex behavior. 
The model proposes the theory of overdominance or sexual antagonism as possible explanation to the survival of a population that exhibit same sex behavior. [2, 3]
The nature of homosexuality is anyway complex and might be divided in different categories.
"Sexual behavior, sexual preference and sexual orientation are distinct but often conflated concepts." 
Moreover the behavior is difficult to study because of technical reasons (one can't inquire the animals about their preferences, and species who don't exert evident sexual dymorphism are considered heterosexual by default). [1]

## Homosexuality in humans
Studies reveal that there is a high inheritability of the behavior, suggesting an underlying genetic mechanism, although remains unsolved which genes play a major role. [1]
There are three main explanation for the evolution of homosexuality in humans: the same genetic one proposed for animals, help in nurturing the offsprings, gay people pass the "homosexuality genes" by reproduction. [4]

## Personal choice or predisposition
Homosexuality isn't a choice, like it isn't a choice to be hetero. The sexual attraction, although it can be guided, it cannot be completely replaced. I would call it a predisposition. 
Sexual orientation and sexual preference come both from our conscious and subconscious thoughts. 
There are gay reformatories, where people try to impose the heterosexuality. I have no idea about the success rate, 
but I would say is very low.

## Minoritarian behavior
One last thing, being gay will always be controversial in a population and it will always be considered an alternative behavior of the standard heterosexuality.

## Practical considerations
Is homosexuality harmful to today's society? Is homosexual propaganda more harmful? Should the society control sexual behavior of its members? 
If yes, how?
