#Homosexuality

##Gender dynamism
I think we need to start to listen to the Tumblr girls. 
Sexual orientation and gender can be dynamic

##Occurrences of homosexuality in other kingdoms
Homosexual behavior exists in nature because it brings an advantage to the population. (source missing).
This behavior can be either learned or genetic. A genetic analysis that demonstrate the genetic linkage has yet to be discovered. 
Other animals have expressed homosexual behavior, but we lack records prior to 1970 because biologists 
ignored such behaviors. 
Lions use it for dominance assessing (same as the Roman empire), penguins being semelparous (like most birds) 
engage homosexual behavior their entire life. 

##Personal choice or predisposition
Homosexuality isn't a choice, like it isn't a choice to be hetero. The sexual attraction, although it can be guided, it cannot be completely replaced. I would call it a predisposition. 
Sexual orientation and sexual preference come both from our conscious and subconscious thoughts. 
There are gay reformatories, where people try to impose the heterosexuality. I have no idea about the success rate, 
but I would say is very low.

##Minoritarian behavior
One last thing, being gay will always be controversial in a population and it will always be considered an alternative behavior of the standard heterosexuality.

##Practical considerations
Is homosexuality harmful to today's society? Is homosexual propaganda more harmful? Should the society control sexual behavior of its members? 
If yes, how?
