what if

Graeme P, [15.11.16 20:24]
our brain was just in a jar

Graeme P, [15.11.16 20:25]

Hi Connor, and welcome to Freethinkers!

Holographic theory

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 20:25]

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 20:25]
I say could be but should we care?

[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
We shouldnt care

blip, [15.11.16 20:25]
[In reply to Graeme P]
very intriguing

Connor, [15.11.16 20:25]
Its a frustratingly dumb concept

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 20:26]
Can we get hand on this jar? If not why should we think there's one? And not a jar in a jar

Graeme P, [15.11.16 20:26]
we should care what's the point if im just a brain jar

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 20:26]
In a jar jar binks maybe?

the universe, that is

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 20:27]
There's a point until you don't get to proof the existence of the jar which is a self contained problem so it's impossible to proof

Connor, [15.11.16 20:27]
Exactly

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 20:27]
Then what you have is the life you have in front

Connor, [15.11.16 20:27]
Same problem for solipsicism

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 20:27]
And the point of that life is to make the best out of it

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 20:28]

Maurice Greene, [15.11.16 20:34]

It's not all in your head, because the head is a process of the all

Maurice Greene, [15.11.16 20:35]
It's more a relationship thing

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 20:35]

Whether awake or dreaming, you‚Äôre experiencing the same bio-physical process. True, they‚Äôre qualitatively different realities, but if you‚Äôre thinking and feeling, it‚Äôs real. Thus, Ren√© Descartes‚Äô famous statement Cogito, ergo sum (‚ÄúI think, therefore I am‚Äù).

[In reply to Connor]
It doesn't cause reality maybe.... but is what we have to build our stories upon

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:34]
Making it a 3-way problem

Your perception 
The other perception
And a supposedly existing fundamental truth

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:34]
I think this is the key of the problem

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:35]
And we are discussing about a fundamental truth/reality

Connor, [15.11.16 21:35]
Yes

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:35]
Does it exist or not? Might as well exist

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:35]
But what we can figure out is just the first two right?

Connor, [15.11.16 21:35]
An objective reality that exists independantly of our perception

Connor, [15.11.16 21:36]
It is the only player

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:37]
We have ocular witnesses, non ocular witnesses, dna, proof, whatever... that tries to reconstruct a fundamental thing

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:37]
Yet as humans we decided to give the last word to a jury and judge

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:37]
And I think this is important

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:38]
I think we need to work together to figure out not the truth but the most and best plausible truth

Connor, [15.11.16 21:38]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]

Uhm even the scientific method is just a mere human construct

Connor, [15.11.16 21:40]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Of course it is

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:40]
Even the best theories now formulated in a couple of thousands of years will be maybe considered surpassed

Connor, [15.11.16 21:40]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I also agree with this

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:40]
Even the scientific method will be considered surpassed

Connor, [15.11.16 21:41]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Not necessarily. The scientific method is a tool, not a theory

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:41]
One day we will be able to fuse our body with machines, change our genetic code as we need with the help of viruses that now are symbiote of us

Connor, [15.11.16 21:42]
Im failing to see the point your attempting to make

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:42]
We can see and imagine a world where all what we know will change and take an other shape because maybe we acquire a full radiation spectrum view

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:42]
Now that reality would be so far away from the concept of the reality we conceived now it might as well as considered as a different reality

Connor, [15.11.16 21:43]
But we arent talking about our perception of reality, we are talking about a fundamental existence independent of you and me

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:43]
So what's the point in searching for a universe and a fundamental truth that ontologically you know might exist or not?

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:44]
The only thing you have at the end is a "objective" reality described by other subjects.

Connor, [15.11.16 21:44]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
We arent searching for whether it exists. We are searching to discover more about it

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:44]
[In reply to Connor]
Which we can't prove exist

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:44]
[In reply to Connor]
This is also the ultimate goal of the collective perception ü§î

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:45]
To increase our knowledge, on expanding our collective reality

Connor, [15.11.16 21:45]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
We cant prove anything. The point is that unless a fundamental reality is found to be false, it exists

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:45]
Although the philosophical question does an underlying reality exist?  Is unresolvable

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:46]
[In reply to Connor]
Or doesn't

#GeneralQuestion
(like to think but don't know much about history of philosophy, so if its stupid sorry)

all before of those tings...
i am wondering about how it begins? how it begins to searching of the truth? we read it, watch it about it yeah, but who was the first one who suspect about the reality?
what was the first spark?
is it start with dreaming or somethin?

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:46]
As a matter of fact what we have now is the reality seen through the collectivity

Connor, [15.11.16 21:46]
Damn you had me strung along on your chain of logic

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:47]
[In reply to Connor]
Wym?

Connor, [15.11.16 21:47]
But There is a gaping error in it

Connor, [15.11.16 21:47]
we have evidence the world existed before humanity

Connor, [15.11.16 21:47]
and before organic life on our planet

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:47]
[In reply to Connor]
Created by whom this evidence?

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:48]
[In reply to Connor]
Who made that evidence?

Connor, [15.11.16 21:48]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
nobody

Connor, [15.11.16 21:48]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
nobody

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:48]
I'm not saying it has less value cause the humans made it

Connor, [15.11.16 21:48]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
well humans didnt make it

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:48]
I'm saying it is the reality seen by the collectivity

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:48]

They looked at rocks and said those are teeth

Connor, [15.11.16 21:49]
Why do you keep talking about our perception of reality

Connor, [15.11.16 21:49]
It is just that

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:49]
They looked at stars and said they must come somewhere

Connor, [15.11.16 21:49]
A perception

Connor, [15.11.16 21:49]
of something that exists

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:49]
Or is just a story told by somebody else?

Connor, [15.11.16 21:50]
And that has existed long before sapience

[In reply to mr.nobody]
lol

Connor, [15.11.16 21:51]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
nobody told this story

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:51]
[In reply to mr.nobody]
Lol thx! But I think science itself is going in this direction

Connor, [15.11.16 21:52]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Science is definitely not

Connor, [15.11.16 21:53]
Your arguement has so many flaws
1. reality is formed by collective conciousness
2. an objective reality does  ot exist
3 . therefore reality must proceed humanity, or sentience

Connor, [15.11.16 21:54]
your 3rd claim contradicts all of modern science

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:54]
Starting with descartes who started putting reality in question. Having G√∂del saying that if you have a system with arithmetic this system can't proof is validity. Then going to Eisenberg and saying we can't measure electrons velocity and position even with the best instrument. Then opening to the entire quantum field with its probabilistic view of reality. And more and the more science advances the less we find an absolute truth but just a model that better can predict what's next

Connor, [15.11.16 21:55]
That doesnt contradict my logic

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:55]
Science is seen as absolute by many. But being a bickery researcher I know how lovely is to discuss.

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:56]
I know how cool stuff comes out and I know what does it mean to be on the edge of the unkown

Connor, [15.11.16 21:56]
Or affect your assertion

find me some scientists supporting 3.

[In reply to Connor]
Uhm I didn't say it does not exist...

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:57]
I said might exist and might not

Not Eisenberg, his name was Werner Heisenberg.

Connor, [15.11.16 21:57]
if an objective reality exists, a collective one does not

Connor, [15.11.16 21:57]
its one or the other

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:57]
Cause we should pursue the expansion of the "objective" collective reality

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:59]
I put it in "" cause we shouldn't follow any construct of reality but the best one 

The best one for me rn is the scientific and logical one

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:59]
Believing in an underlying truth is what most religious people propose

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 21:59]
Believing in it... that's what we are talking about

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 22:00]
You believe in a absolute reality

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 22:01]
Seems contradictory yet...

Connor, [15.11.16 22:06]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
But you are advocating for essentially creationism, with humans as the creator

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 22:07]
[In reply to Connor]
And maybe not... is still pretty raw tbh

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 22:07]
And I need to inform myself better on perceptions and stuff

Connor, [15.11.16 22:07]
You are never making arguements, you just go "but what if"

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 22:07]
Still a human without perceptions goes pretty crazy... funny right?

It's my nature as a debater

Pella Jiriya, [15.11.16 22:08]
Sometimes is exacerbating
