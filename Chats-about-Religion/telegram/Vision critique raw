The premise

I'm a young man, almost 30. I decided to share my thoughts about how a religion should be. The recent problems caused by extremists of various religions made me thought that we need something new. We need as humanity a new way to see the world. (Spitz Park, 8.6.2016)

This religion is meant to be a way of achieving coexistence in the human species and to promote progress. We will later define what is meant by progress and coexistence in more detail, but both terms should be taken in the literal form. Progress[2]: Development towards an improved or more advanced condition. Coexistence[3]: he state or condition of living in harmony despite different ideologies or interests.

How to create my religion?

Create an account on GitHub
Fork the repository (the repository is the text of the religion)
Make your changes, bring contents and add or delete elements.
Once you finished propose a pull request on my repository
It will maybe be accepted or spawn a discussion.
I update the master of my religion with your changes.

You said. If is right then doesn't need to change. I don't believe is right so it must change.

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:37]
[In reply to Vision]
Yes, necessarily. If you claim the opposite then elaborate

Vision, [28.10.16 21:37]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]

The stories of the Old Testament can all be found in older religions

Hmmmm

Pella Jiriya, [28.10.16 21:38]
I like to talk about religion

I dont want to face the actions for someone elses stupid decisions

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:39]

As do the actions of the catholic church. Wars were fought because of it

Lol actually let me find new local minima of human intelligence

You are always forced to face things like that. You don't have absolute power

Ok but i might have the power to stop this

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:41]

Why does the belief of an individual bother you when a larger belief system like that causes wars?

Pella Jiriya, [28.10.16 21:41]

You seem to be a very "bothered" person in general

[In reply to ‚ç£ DEMONS be DRIVEN ‚ç£]
Fear the butterfly effect

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:43]
[In reply to Vision]
No, not even might. For that you need to be persuasive, which you are not.

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:43]
[In reply to Vision]
Why should one fear that which is natural?

‚ç£ DEMONS be DRIVEN ‚ç£, [28.10.16 21:44]

Butterfly effect.. for now my religion has me as a active contributior and follower and 2 other contributors, not follower... and I pretty much forced them in as contributors

Do you fear to go outside because you know of the existence of storms? Do you fear to drive your car because you know the probability of death is high?

Vision, [28.10.16 21:46]
[In reply to Mathew The Brit]
Yes

Vision, [28.10.16 21:47]
But i try to hide it

Vision, [28.10.16 21:47]
Control it maybe

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:48]
[In reply to Vision]
Then you fear life itself.

[In reply to Mathew The Brit]
So what

Pella Jiriya, [28.10.16 21:51]
I'm quite satisfied by the high regard Vision has toward the Schr√∂dinger religion

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:51]
[In reply to Vision]
So you have no place lecturing people over your fears. You fear Pella might change the world with his view because of the butterfly effect but you also fear going outside. Control you fear, learn to see what is worth being feared and what is not

Vision, [28.10.16 21:52]
Wouldnt you try to stop a stupid actions before it could become big if you could

Pella Jiriya, [28.10.16 21:52]
He say it's a stupid concept, because it might actually work! with a butterfly effect, and people will follow it.

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:52]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I concur. He seems to think it may change alot of peoples view on life

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:53]
[In reply to Vision]
Would you stop driving cars because there's a small chance of you crashing and dying?

Vision, [28.10.16 21:53]
[In reply to Mathew The Brit]
Its also pity towards the stupid people which might follow him

‚ç£ DEMONS be DRIVEN ‚ç£, [28.10.16 21:54]
It's not healthy to live with so much fear

‚ç£ DEMONS be DRIVEN ‚ç£, [28.10.16 21:54]
It will only end up limiting you

Pella Jiriya, [28.10.16 21:55]
[In reply to Vision]
Maybe there will be some intelligent ones...

Vision, [28.10.16 21:55]
Fear is what keeps people alive

‚ç£ DEMONS be DRIVEN ‚ç£, [28.10.16 21:55]
There are people you can talk to work through some of that

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:55]
[In reply to Vision]
Your distorted view on how things "should be done" is not something we measure peoples intelligence by. You claim followers of this belief undeniably have a lower IQ than others. Elaborate

Vision, [28.10.16 21:55]
[In reply to ‚ç£ DEMONS be DRIVEN ‚ç£]
Then what are test dummies for

Vision, [28.10.16 21:56]
[In reply to Mathew The Brit]
Its not about iq

‚ç£ DEMONS be DRIVEN ‚ç£, [28.10.16 21:56]
Test dummies are for safety ratings

‚ç£ DEMONS be DRIVEN ‚ç£, [28.10.16 21:56]
Not for people to live their lives in fear

Vision, [28.10.16 21:56]
Being desperate could be a variable too

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:56]
[In reply to Vision]
Then elaborate please. And tell us why you pity the so called "stupid people"

Pella Jiriya, [28.10.16 21:57]
[In reply to Vision]
I'm not dumb, nor desperate and I'm the only follower...

Vision, [28.10.16 21:57]

Who is telling you arent

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:57]

Test dummies are used for a variety of things. How many of them would you like to hear?

Mathew The Brit, [28.10.16 21:58]

It's mostly based on strange fears

Did you know up until a few years ago no shop was open on a Sunday in Germany because on that day god rested? And did you know in the city I live in, nothing is allowed to be built higher than the great cathedral, because it needs to be closest to god?
