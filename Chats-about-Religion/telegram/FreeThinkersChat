He used that cat experiment as a metaphor for how absurd the conclusions of quantum physics are in some interpretations. And if you observe something, then it becomes that. It is not 2 things at the same time, that would be logical contradiction.

"According to Schr√∂dinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that the cat remains both alive and dead until the state is observed.

You're misinterpreting that, though. Now you are comparing scientific methodology and mathematics in physics and philosophical ideas.

According to its founder, Daniel Kriegman, Yoism (founded 1994) combines rational inquiry, empiricism, and science with Spinozan or Einsteinian pantheism.[26][27][28] Inspired by the Linux operating system, Kriegman describes his religion as "open-source" and explains that, similar to open-source software projects, participants in Yoism do not owe their allegiance to any leader and that their sense of authority emerges via group consensus decision-making.[1][29][30] Yoism adopted the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike copyleft license for sharing original works in May 2015.[31]

He made some open-source religion and presented it like it was innovative, and I found it on Wikipedia after 1 google search. Lol

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:49]
You heard religion you called it crap

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:50]
Then revised your stance saying others do the same

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:50]
If it was rational, it would be philosophy and science.

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:50]
Are there any on github?

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:50]
No, read what I just said.

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:50]
Where you can interact?

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:50]
Easily?

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:50]
I'm sure they have something like Wikipedia.

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:50]
Using modern social media?

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:50]
[In reply to Stefan]
Which is crap

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:50]
Cause Wikipedia has a huge fallacy

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:51]
If you say that those are religions

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:51]
Then mine is a valid too

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:51]
Thx for letting me discover those

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:51]
Use google next time bro

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:51]
But as I said

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:52]
[In reply to Stefan]
I did and I will

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:52]
Google tho isn't really the answer to everything.

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:52]
This is really basic man, you were like "oh shit" when I showed you all this

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:52]
Uhm?

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:53]
It's an idea I thought a couple of month ago, born as an hobby

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:53]
Seeing others using that medium for the religion is good

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:53]
And you didn't think to google the concept one time?

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:53]
[In reply to Stefan]
I did üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:53]
And haven't found that

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:53]
Since I started calling it open source religion last week

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:54]
I googled: "open-source religion" and "git hub religion"

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:54]
Found it in secs

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:54]
It's an idea that has just been born

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:54]
If I wouldn't told you

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:54]
Open source religion

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:54]
You wouldn't even have Googled that

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:54]
üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:54]
You're being obnoxious

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:54]
The concept is literally 22 years old bro

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:55]
And envious cause you didn't have the same idea

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:55]
But don't worry

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:55]
You can fork my repository

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:55]
Or the one of the others and make it a religion

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:55]
And this is what I first asked you

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:55]
I'm not a fan of religions bro

Balraj, [13.11.16 15:55]

I didn't say religions were stupid

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:56]
[In reply to Stefan]
You attacked mine as if it was stupid

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:56]
[In reply to –£–ª—É–≥–±–µ–∫ NZT-48]
I mean, he cares a lot. If he weren't acting so arrogantly, I wouldn't have called him out on anything. Don't join the chat if you don't know context

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:56]
I can't tell you about the other open source ones

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:57]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I meant the misunderstanding of quantum physics

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:57]
But surely, mine is about discovering values in a new world

Just ask www.reddit.com/r/askscience

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:57]
And is just a particular way of thinking

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:58]
Where two opposites can live and coexist together

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:58]
I am not physicist, I can't explain this well. But these people can, they have degrees

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:58]
That is dialectic monism, not quantum physics

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:58]
[In reply to Stefan]
And there's also trolls

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:58]
Most are serious

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:58]
I guess you could send an email to some professor and ask about it

Stefan, [13.11.16 15:59]
Or institute or website

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:59]
[In reply to Stefan]
The example is famous, touches the question, and brings up the duality...

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:59]
Idk how to explain you better that this is kind of a nice mental trick to accept both sides

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 15:59]
The existence and non existence

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 16:00]
I'm not here trying to demostrate quantum physics?

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 16:00]
Neither teach science

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 16:00]
Nor basing my religion on that

Stefan, [13.11.16 16:00]
But then, don't pretend like it has something to do with science

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 16:00]

I'm not?

Yes

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 16:01]
I called it schrodinger, as it could be called pellanesim

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 16:01]
I said it before

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 16:01]
But you kind of doing

Stefan, [13.11.16 16:01]
It is like if I write some article on homeopathy and call it Schrodringer medication theory, and then connect it to the two states in quantum physics. It is just going to fool people

Will, [13.11.16 16:01]

People accept death for the wrong reasons. For instance religious self sacrifice. 

Your answer is individual and isn't different from a religious one imo.

I will add that my approach is individual as well. But I don't even attempt to give an answer.

Pella Jiriya, [13.11.16 16:02]

It is individual, but it is a position that many philosophers and philosophies take. Even those we regard as nihilists usually describe a purpose.

Now, we could take a discussion about ethics and the meaning of life. But at another point. I recommend reading about existentialism, utilitarism and etc. if you have existential crisis.
