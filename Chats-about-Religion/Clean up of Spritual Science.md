### What is love?

Milena, [18.10.16 12:25]
I would like to ask you guys a question. What do you think about Love. How would you describe it? What is it in your opinion? What is love and what isn't and why? 
I believe there are many different ways to answer this question. I personally have a very spiritual view on this that many people usually don't share. So I'm interested to hear your opinion :)

Pella Jiriya, [18.10.16 12:38]
Love is a feeling that runs between people. 
There's many kind of love, from the maternal to the one that a desperate 13 yo girl has for Justin Bieber.
Albeit those two are completely different humanity tends to categorize them with the word love.
Love in general means that you would do anything for the other person, even the extreme sacrifice of giving your life to them.
Love in my opinion happens only if the feeling is biunivoque, meaning love has to come from both sides, or is just a crush or an obsession.
This is in contrast with many humans behavior but this allows me to define better what is love.
Excluding all the monodirectional loves, the feeling assumes a fundamental in our society, and is a feeling of benevolence toward somebody special.
Love between people in love (couple) assumes different forms, from the discovery phase to the boredom phase, there's many more and all are part of the faucet of a complicate feeling like love.

Milena, [18.10.16 12:40]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I think most people would agree with this. But I personally don't. I categorize this as "egoistic love", what people think that love is but in my opinion it's more something like attachment. I won't say more tho, I would like to hear more opinions first and every opinion is legit :)

Milena, [18.10.16 12:41]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]-> which reply? damn you copy function of telegram desktop
Yes it definitely includes a lot of forms and types.

Milena, [18.10.16 12:42]
Another key word for me in this context is "unconditional love"

Pella Jiriya, [18.10.16 12:44]
The directinality of love is really important
Imho
And you can't love somebody who doesn't love you back
That's not love

"Zero=infinity
Space seems empty, yet it is jam packed with information. It has been discovered (Nassim Haramein) that the density of the vacuum has 10 to the 93 grams per centimeter cubed. 
When your mind is empty, you'll find it too is jam packed with information. There is no difference between your mind and space... Ultimately, there is no difference between you and space other than the .000000001% particle fluctuation. The other 99.9999999% is space. We don't learn new things really. We just remember. Receive. You are and always with be the whole of creation. Silence the mind and remember."

> Trevor James McGrath

Pella Jiriya, [18.10.16 12:45]
I think you copied some wrong measures here
10 to the 93 g per cm3 is extremely dense
Btw I would look to that with real a big care since we have limits on our metric system assuming the law of modern physics... and that measure smell of breaking them

Milena, [18.10.16 12:45]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I wouldn't agree. But ask yourself first who is I and who is someone? From a spiritual point of view this is not so easy to answer.

Milena, [18.10.16 12:48]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ok, I'm not an expert on this topic :) I believe the person who wrote it actually just wanted to show how everything is connected.

Pella Jiriya, [18.10.16 12:48]
[In reply to Milena]
I, is what I define as I, you are what I define as you.
People identify in themselves naturally and in general is corresponding to the physical represent of the self.

Pella Jiriya, [18.10.16 12:50]
[In reply to Milena]
The boat of eratostene. It's something it will blow your mind then.
Moreover bringing up a physical measure without meaning is terrible taste in an aphorism.

Milena, [18.10.16 12:50]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes but is this all? Is this what and who we really are or is this just an illusion and our real self is more than that?

Milena, [18.10.16 12:52]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I don't judge, it's just how someone wanted to express it and for some people it will be helpful in understanding what he wanted to say anyway.

I'm searching for a nice article I posted on all this...

Milena, [18.10.16 12:55]
Ok Pella, since I can't find it right now I would like to mention the Ego as Part of your self. I believe that you identify with it a lot. 
I can recommend a movie about the ego, it's called "Revolver".

Revolver is an awesome movie.. when i watched it however i did not know it was about the Ego!!
Haha that movie is mind blowing!! You should have watched it longer, after it actually ends they describe what it was all about.

James David, [18.10.16 13:17]
The scene where he is basically fighting himself.... oh my days ... i was watching that like what the hell is going on... oh how foolish i was then ha ha.. i thought it was a Phyco Thriller and thats why it was so weired..

Milena, [18.10.16 13:18]
[In reply to James David]
I have to laugh so hard about this üòÇüòÇüòÇ I can totally see now why so many people have been that confused after watching the movie. It was criticized a lot because people where not getting it üòÅ

James David, [18.10.16 13:26]
I dont think anyone understood it... i did try once... someone did a metaphysics video about the movie
But i wasnt that keen on Metaphysics then..

Abdel Rahim Guemmat, [18.10.16 13:27]
I'll notice you when I see it and I'll tell you my impression. Thanks!

Milena, [22.10.16 11:19]
[In reply to Milena]
Since we were talking about this last time. There was still a lot of confusion about the 'I'.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 12:52]
[In reply to Milena]
I don't believe in a soul
What I do now?
I don't even know what a souls should be?

Milena, [22.10.16 13:02]
Good question. To me there isn't a "real" difference since all is consciousness. But I would describe soul as what our subconscious mind is. All our emotions. It's difficult to describe it in English but I sometimes am able to astral travel and I had a few near death experiences. I feel and see a major shift in consciousness and am entering another dimension of it, another layer of reality. "I" leave my body then and am operating through an astral body...usually I find myself standing next to my physical body and seeing everything else that is happening around me in physical reality, but it's still slightly different, because the frequency I'm operating from is higher and time and space behave differently and so on. And also emotions in this dimension kind of replace "mind". It's very difficult to describe seriously ^^

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:04]
I see!

Milena, [22.10.16 13:05]
I think it's difficult to believe or understand this if you never experienced it yourself...and most people probably don't even want to experience it because it can be extremely frightening since it feels like dying and losing one's self almost every time. But it also is a pretty amazing experience. You can visit friends and family who are far away in just an instant and you can even visit dead people and other dimensions etc. But again, one has to experience it to believe it. For everyone who isn't able to get there all by themselves I recommend DMT.... But this is a whole other story haha

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:06]
I've never been outside my body and outside my physical boundaries. I've been outside my body with fantasy. But with fantasy I'm also able to fly or to be a semi angel with ice magic power...

Milena, [22.10.16 13:07]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
That is true :) you could start experimenting with lucid dreaming first, this is easier to learn than astral traveling but it helps to prepare for astral traveling.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:07]
I understand what you mean between mind and subconscious, I would rather not define my subconscious as my soul tho, since rn my subconscious is a 4 yo very whiny who's afraid of responsibility.

Milena, [22.10.16 13:09]
And about "fantasy"... I think that we can't imagine anything that doesn't exist. This might sound stupid but I believe in the multiverse theory, which means that there is an infinite number of parallel realities and that everything we can think of actually exists somewhere. So whenever you "fantasize" about something you might be actually just shifting your consciousness a little bit into another reality :)

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:09]
Then I had one tangible near death experience and what I saw and felt was fear, and a regression to the primordial self. Not really a travel toward the outside but an eye opening experience that made me realize that many thought could change when a gun will be pointed at my head.
I'm a very rational person and a scientist. But I have also an emotional part that I have difficulties to describe and maybe somehow control.

Milena, [22.10.16 13:11]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Oh yes, that is you soul haha and it behaves that way because you block it. You are not treating and caring for it properly :) maybe that's why your higher self brought you in this group, to get in touch with other aspects of your self too, especially with the ones that go beyond physical reality.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:12]
About DMT. Remember drugs and psychedelics, shift our perceptions brutally, also the perceptions of our thoughts, for example DMT can give you an universal sonder, but remember that this is the byproduct of our mind.
Same as when one smokes weed and has those fantastic and enlightened dicussion with oneself. But at the end those thoughts weren't special, it was the drug making them feel special.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:13]
[In reply to Milena]
I have lucid dreams since I was a kid. Having asthma helped me to control the dreams... if you really want I can explain you how.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:14]
[In reply to Milena]
This might be. Although within the laws of physics a multiverse is not the only explanation of how our world works. So I prefer to be open to more theories rather than  focusing on one

Milena, [22.10.16 13:15]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes exactly! You are facing it. Fear is a huge component of all that and needs to be transcended. But I tell you, before you are able to address even one block to get in touch with your soul more you will have to go through that fear of losing your life. And after you did it there will be unbelievable freedom, love, happiness and joy. But after that you will see that it was still just a little bit of who you really are and eventually you will travel deeper and then again that fear will arise, over and over again... This fear is also very important but at the same it it's what blocks us the most. The ego usually tells us then that it is not worth experiencing all this negativity and that we can have it all just staying above the "water" (water is a subconscious metaphor for emotions) in the physical realm... Buut the ego is a little liar that doesn't want to see us evolve and being our true self üòÖ

Anyone read Dune here
By Frank Herbert
That series is pretty heavy
Especially the parts that discuss the interaction between religion and politics

Milena, [22.10.16 13:16]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes and no :D this is funny, because again, all is consciousness. Mind and body and everything too, they are just part of the illusion, the dream this consciousness constantly creates ^^ so whether you see it as biochemical reactions or spiritual awakening, it's pretty much the same ^^

Milena, [22.10.16 13:17]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
True. But right now this theory makes the most sense and it also explains the findings in quantum physics :)

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:19]
[In reply to Milena]
I disagree with you... I had trascendental experiences, in very particular moments of my life. All those experiences brought me to have a real vision, a vision of what I see and can measure, other philosophical questions, like does a god exist? are self containing problems, which we need to answer but do not really help the grow of the individual itself.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:20]
[In reply to Milena]
The big difference is the biochemical reaction bring conclusions and predictable models. The spiritual awakening brings only a culture of the individual projected on others but hardly any practical utility

Milena, [22.10.16 13:20]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ok, you don't necessarily have to answer those questions. But still, you can't understand the outside if you can't understand the inside. This will become very obvious, no matter what road you travel in the search for answers, as long as you continue searching.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:21]
[In reply to Milena]
I would say that quantum physics allowed the possibility of a multiverse not vice versa

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:22]
[In reply to Milena]
This is true, nothing should stop you to continue learning a part from mental disability and age brain damage

Milena, [22.10.16 13:22]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Wouldn't agree to this. The problem is that you assume that there is an objective reality, but I also work in a scientific field and my boyfriend too, he is a chemist, and I can tell you, this kind of reality doesn't exist ^^ we can't even define what reality is. 
So like you said yourself, being open is the best way to discover and understand more.

Milena, [22.10.16 13:24]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Actually all the multiverse theories came up even without quantum physics and make a lot sense on their own. But quantum physics fit very well in this theory and they can both be used to understand each.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:26]
[In reply to Milena]
Sure thing, but my mind isn't infinite, I can learn only a subset of concept. I prefer to learn the one that help progressing humanity in a tangible way and keep the self containing one as an hobby, something ludicrous. 

Trying to explain the phenomenon we see with modern science and technology is what we should aim for, and for the things that are inexplicable then develop a new theory. 
Giving an interpretation based on intangible and non demostrable theory is fun, but shouldn't be the goal of our existence, of course if we want humanity to progress.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:27]
[In reply to Milena]
Quantum physics is a concept born  in the 1920. When are the first multiverse theory spoken about with a solid mathematical and scientific background?

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:29]
And as far as I recall the ancient history doesn't even consider that since the universe was one and only appartaing to a god. But I'm actually not very well informed about other cultures.

Milena, [22.10.16 13:29]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I believe our minds are infinite haha it's just that one concept we believe in is that something can be finite and our mind is too. We also believe that not everything is possible but higher dimensions will teach us that this too is a false belief. But I agree that to get there we need limitations first, just to ask questions and be motivated to discover more.

Milena, [22.10.16 13:33]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I think there won't be a real progress in society if we can't manage to transcend our egos more. Just look what we are doing to each other and the whole world because we can't see how everything is connected. And once we see more of that connection we will be able to get past the capitalistic ego system and start to spend more energy into creating and research, better technology etc. Then into destroying the planet, fighting each other and consuming more than we need. That's why a spiritual (r)Evolution is so important, this would also give a huge boost to science, economics and politics.

Milena, [22.10.16 13:35]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I also think that everyone should choose their goals as they like. They are no right and wrongs in my world. And discovering the self is actually a very scientific procedure because it follows a universal logic, like math. What you said is equivalent to saying math is of no use because it's just theoretical üòÖ

Milena, [22.10.16 13:36]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Hmm not sure to be honest. But I have a very nice video of a podium discussion of worlds most famous scientists talking about multiverse theories if you are interested :)

Milena, [22.10.16 13:39]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
This is interesting and here we have logic again: Multiverse and Universe are not opposites. In fact it's one way or another a fractal construct (and this is the only way EVERYTHING can make sense anyway). 1=Infinity=0

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:39]
[In reply to Milena]
I believe that our mind has huge limitations. For example our ability to describe transitions, gradients and such suck a lot. This is why the human mind tend to categorize things instead of representing them as a continuum.

Milena, [22.10.16 13:40]
Btw I'm happy to have you in this group Pella, you are asking good questions :)

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:43]
[In reply to Milena]
I think that's not really the way to, it is a nice proposition but does the same mistake as all major religion. Forgets that the human is a human, and will behave instinctively and primordial, erudite and wise, stupid and intelligent.
Humans should be the center of study from now on, not nonexistent people in the sky or intangible dimensions! 

You say if everybody will have a spiritual awekaning we will have a stronger humanity. Yes probably it will work even if I'm not sure that your spiritual awakening is better than any other.

We will have also a perfect society with Lenin communism, or with other utopic paradigms that forget to consider what is a human and how it behaves.

Milena, [22.10.16 13:44]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes I agree, but the funny thing  is that the universe is a huge paradox. "divide to unite". Limited and limitless are just two sides of one coin. Polarity etc. it's all crucial for creating Oneness. It all comes to 1=Infinity=0 again. I believe you will be able to understand what this means. Otherwise it can be very helpful and interesting to just think about it: "why are limitations important to create unlimited freedom?" - questions like this are always mind blowing and as soon as we find the answers and really understand it we get a huge step closer to understanding reality and the nature of all that is.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:45]
[In reply to Milena]
I think right and wrong exist, is how and what we determine is wrong and right that needs to be discussed. For example being gay 100 years ago was wrong, now is a fundamental right of existence. 
And being a pedophile now is completely wrong. Will it be wrong in future also?

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:46]
[In reply to Milena]
Mathematically doesn't really make sense to equal a 0 to infinity to a natural number tho

Milena, [22.10.16 13:46]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes. You are awesome! Here we have polarity AGAIN!  Haha the nature of all things always containes polarity, opposites, harmony and chaos at the same time. But still what I'm saying is possible, but this is another story :) 
But yeah, I totally agree, we can't just face one side of the coin and ignore the other.

I think all spiritual awakenings are pretty much the same :D they just differ in intensity.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 13:49]
I think we should stop being spiritual and finally start to talk about humans
Define ethics and define what is a good way to implement different cultures! Is it modularity or we should chose a main line? 
What we define as acceptable or not? 
What would be an awesome human being? What are the basic laws that will help us to build a society devoted to the progress?
What kind of progress we want? 
What is rage, fear, and other feelings? What is love? Who can have love or not? Is it right to love your mom? Sexually? Is it not why?
Let's stop hiding behind the word normal
Let's think how we can coexist in freedom with each other
When is right killing a man? When is not?

Milena, [22.10.16 13:52]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Hmm yeah you see that's why there is no objective right or wrong for me, I try not to judge. Good and evil are all just concepts. They are good and helpful as long as we need them but they can be overcome actually. Judging polarities makes it duality. There is just a spectrum, chaos and harmony. We don't like chaos (because we don't really understand it) and desire harmony, that's why we judge the one as evil and the other as good. Murder or something like that is considered chaotic in universal sense. I hope you understand what I mean.

[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Love is always right. I see that you have a huge interest into those questions and I promise we can go deeper into this another time, but I think we are still not "there", we still need to discuss some other things (like what love is and this question is correlated with what or who you are) and then we can try to address the right or wrong question again.

When is rightful to kill a man, is situational, depending case to case, or there's universal rules that governs this act?

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 14:00]

And the one? Btw I would disagree... because zero describe the absence of something while infinity describes a measure.

Milena, [22.10.16 14:01]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Kids are much closer to Universal truth than most adults. Think about love and teach your kid to love, not egoistically but unconditionally. Show your child how everything is connected and how it all is one at the end. This is the best way to teach morality and the only way to really understand it.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 14:01]

[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ok, maybe you can replace it with a formula that is more fitting but actually this is the one that is most easy to understand. Ok if you can understand how everything is nothing then you can start thinking fractal and see that the totality of everything is One too.

Milena, [22.10.16 14:05]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
There we have the "mistake" :D that's why I asked what love is the other time.

Milena, [22.10.16 14:11]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Oh okaaay... I wouldn't start with that... Oh boy haha this is a concept, I mean the concept of exchange and trade, that kills altruism in children.... Puuuh i don't have much time to describe it now but to sum it up: infants help other people altruistically, without wanting something in reward. But as soon as we start rewarding them, they stop helping when they don't get anything for it. 
The intrinsic motivation to do something for another person is being replaced with an extrinsic materialistic motivation. 
So for all parents: don't reward your children materialistically for doing something good. Praise is ok. 
But I know that you were asking something slightly different, I just wanted to point out that you shouldn't teach your child that concept of exchange and trade too early... This can ruin some good traits in children.

Milena, [22.10.16 14:12]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
This is not the kind of love I talk about anyway. It's rather desire. Your love for your child, as long as it is unconditional, that's the love I talk about. And yes, I'm saying that one should love everyone that way.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:30]
[In reply to Milena]
Makes no sense, fractals describe a finite structure but gets fragmented to infinite. This what's the beauty of them.
Like I can see a fractal surface tending to one... but that is not equal to zero.
Moreover fractal math require also understanding of half dimentions, or quotient dimensions... I'm not really sure that you're following Mandelbrot teachings when you say that a fractal is equal to one....

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:31]
[In reply to Milena]
I know but you're revolutionizing the definition of love in something isn't love anymore. You can call it love no problem, but you'll not be understood by others... which kind of elude the principle

Do you have any study about this? Because I would probably disagree on that.

No I'm not stuck üòÇ I see where your misinterpretations of fractals come...

Milena, [22.10.16 16:34]
I just googled quick and that's what I found, I didn't read it but maybe it explains it better than I can:

[In reply to Milena]
Ehm this works only with the Z domain... üò∂

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:47]
Doesn't work with the R domain since it's not ordeable

Milena, [22.10.16 16:47]
Ok I have no idea what that means ^^

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:47]
Now explain me how fractals that are generated using the complex domain are in line of what you say?
There's types of numbers in math:
Positive Natural numbers (N)
Positive/negative natural n (Z)
Fractions (Q)
-------
Rational numbers (R)
Irrational numbers (C)

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:49]
I put a line between the countable infinite and the uncountable infinites

Milena, [22.10.16 16:50]
Ok, what I mean by fractal is something that expands Infinitly within itself (I have no idea how to say it in English).

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:50]
I think you should take a deep breath and before raping mathematical concepts and building theories upon it. You should grasp at least the basics

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:51]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
This is one of the most famous fractals, mandelbrot

Milena, [22.10.16 16:51]
Ok, I'm not an expert when it comes to math. 
But Pella, seriously, try to understand what I'm trying to tell you, it's not that difficult. The totality of everything is One, can we agree upon this?

Milena, [22.10.16 16:51]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I know

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:52]
There's a nice talk on youtube that explaines the basics and the implications, with comments from mandelbrot itself
Is a good start if you want to continue to use the word fractal

Milena, [22.10.16 16:52]
But you are holding unto that concept so much that you can't see beyond them, I'm trying to show you the greater picture

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:52]
[In reply to Milena]
No cause I have no idea what you're trying to say? üòë

Milena, [22.10.16 16:53]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Haha ok :D I might give it a try.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:53]
[In reply to Milena]
I don't want to see beyond if is not correct from the start üòë

Milena, [22.10.16 16:53]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes I see this and I can't get why haha. Ok then let's try from the beginning. The totality of everything is what?

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:53]
How can you build concepts on false premises... that's where scientology comes from

Milena, [22.10.16 16:54]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I think you just don't understand what I'm trying to say.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:54]
[In reply to Milena]
What is the totality of everything?üòê

Milena, [22.10.16 16:54]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I'm asking you

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:55]
[In reply to Milena]
But I don't know what you mean by totality? You mean the sum of our universe?  I'm really confused

Milena, [22.10.16 16:55]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes for example :) don't be, I'm sure we can move past confusion if we really want to understand each other üëç

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:56]
[In reply to Milena]
Sure help me

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:56]
So how do you sum stuff in the universe? A sheep + a cow? What is it? And for quantistic measures like taste? What do we sum there?

Milena, [22.10.16 16:57]
Ok, I will come back to you later, I have to do something else now. Just explain how you would answer my question about the totality of everything. And I also asked a spiritual friend who is advanced with math an everything, so he might help as well.

Milena, [22.10.16 16:57]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
We sum everything that is

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:58]
[In reply to Milena]
Awww i love it üòÇ thx

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 16:59]
[In reply to Milena]
I can't imagine as of now a paradigm that will allow me to sum everything with the operator plus. Even if we redefine the operator...

Milena, [22.10.16 17:00]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
You see, you have to expand your thinking here. It's not math it's philosophy. It follows more or less the same rules, which are logic, but you don't count, you imagine, logically tho

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:02]
You're not actually doing philosophy. You're inventing üòë

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:02]
Sum requires a plus operator

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:02]
The plus operator can be anything you define

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:02]
But there's so many measures in the universe

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:03]
That I don't even  know how to make a big enough definition of the plus operator to fit everything that is in it

Milena, [22.10.16 17:03]
Omg noooooooo Pella Hahaha oh boy... Let's see if I can find an article on this or maybe another member here would mind to explain

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:04]
üòÅ please

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:05]
Cause the totality of everything is a concept that doesn't make sense till now

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:05]
If you don't mean a sum but you mean what is everything?

Milena, [22.10.16 17:05]
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:05]
Everything is what you define as it what exist.

Milena, [22.10.16 17:05]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes you can say it like this too

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:07]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
^^

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:08]
Or non exist

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:08]
Everything depends from how you define what is everything

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:08]
And what you want to consider as everything

Milena, [22.10.16 17:08]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ok we are moving towards the right direction

Milena, [22.10.16 17:08]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
I would include everything that is and isn't

Milena, [22.10.16 17:09]
Don't try to concretely define this, that is not possible haha

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:09]
Then has no meaning

Milena, [22.10.16 17:09]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Noooooooo xD

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:09]
Yes

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:10]
I can say everything inside this house I'm in rn or everything in the universe

Milena, [22.10.16 17:10]
Oh boy, I seriously have to come back to you later ^^
But yes it is important to understand the nature of life

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:10]
Not really üò£

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:11]
I think you're so full of Astral concepts that you find explaining your theory of living and life that you forgot completely that there's other interpretations equally and maybe more valuable

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:13]
When you say everything is connected I give you right, matter itself is in a continuous transformation, and we are for example made of different matter then when we are born. The atoms that compose us, change and disperse in the environment.

Milena, [22.10.16 17:14]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Haha I could say the same to you :) I try to combine all the concepts. What I'm aiming at is polarity and the paradox nature of the universe.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:14]
Then physics uses the term energy, and basically both matters and electromagnetic waves are reconducible to energy. (After Einstein theories).

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:15]
[In reply to Milena]
Uhm I have a rudimentary knowledge of physics, math, biology, and things that made possible me and you communicating even if there's 1000s of km between us...

Milena, [22.10.16 17:15]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Matter and Energy now even seem to be the same. But again, we can go through it in this level, but I wanted to do it from a philosophical perspective. But ok, we can try it like this too

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:16]
What you're trying to explain me in a very bad way is the presence of a soul (?), god math (?) And totality of everything (?)

Milena, [22.10.16 17:16]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ok that's nice and I have knowledge about a few other things. Why not combining it instead of trying to figure out who's concept is superior?

Milena, [22.10.16 17:17]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ehm not really üòÖ

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:18]
[In reply to Milena]
I'm not trying to say I have a superior concept... I just really don't get what you're trying to say with 1=infinity=0 üòë

Milena, [22.10.16 17:18]
But since you are in a spiritual group, yes, it always will have to do with more than what meets the eye and you can call it God...i rather call it universe or collective consciousness.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:19]
I have a religion, I have a very strong faith, and I've come to the conclusion that God both exist and doesn't exist at the same time.

Milena, [22.10.16 17:19]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes I know and I understand why. And you are right criticizing it the way you do. I'm just a bit frustrated that you are not trying to go away from your mathematical rules and see what I mean by this ^^

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:20]
I personally concluded that God doesn't exist. And I don't need a supernatural power to explain the world.

Milena, [22.10.16 17:20]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ok, this goes in a similar direction as what I mean with paradox and why I say 1=0

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:20]
[In reply to Milena]
Because you're using mathematical concepts... you can redefine them and then we can talks üòÅ

Milena, [22.10.16 17:20]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
But isn't this just a matter of definition?

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:21]
[In reply to Milena]
This is a mathematical obscenity... üò∂

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:21]
[In reply to Milena]
Not really. I found my peace in life without it

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:21]
But my faith accounts also for people that need it

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:23]
If you're interested the faith comes from Schr√∂dinger postulates and the duality of particles and waves.

Light for example is both a particle and a wave..

The most famous pop science example of Schr√∂dinger is the cat in the box

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:23]
You know about it?

Rocky of Arabia, [22.10.16 17:25]
The simultaneous states of the cat. Do you think this means you can consciously affect what you observe?

Milena, [22.10.16 17:26]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes :D I know

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:26]
[In reply to Rocky of Arabia]
The second sentence is part of a next theory
But the fact that the cat is dead AND alive at the same time

Rocky of Arabia, [22.10.16 17:26]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Until you observe it though, right?

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:26]
The "and" is such a fundamental word.

Rocky of Arabia, [22.10.16 17:27]
Then it's one or the other

Milena, [22.10.16 17:27]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes I know :) And I agree. But I see a preblem here.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:27]
It means is both alive and death at the same time.

Rocky of Arabia, [22.10.16 17:28]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Simultaneously

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:28]
[In reply to Rocky of Arabia]
Until you observe it and then the paradigm collapses in one of the other. But until you don't know what's inside, or you can't proof it because is a self contained problem, we can safely assume that both exist and doesn't exist.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:29]
Now if consciousness is involved in the observation, this is an other complex story

Milena, [22.10.16 17:29]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes, that's what I mean with polarity and also that the universe is paradox. It is always everything and nothing, like it exists and doesn't exist

Rocky of Arabia, [22.10.16 17:29]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yeah I understand. What I find interesting is how it chooses state when you observe it.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:31]
[In reply to Milena]
Although here I don't agree. There's reality that we can perceive (reality doesn't mean that for everybody is perceived the same) just that there's something real and within a set of rules we can predict useful outcomes. If I touch the switch light goes on, if I wait till morning sun will rise.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:33]
[In reply to Rocky of Arabia]
It's depending on the problem! And technically he doesn't choose at the moment if he will die or not.
The experiment is bound to a fluctuating probability.
This means that some scientist at that time found the cat dead, killed by the poison before, and some will find it alive because the poison didn't ticked.
But if we can't open the box and still want to progress and make conclusion on the cat we can assume it might be alive and dead.

Milena, [22.10.16 17:35]
[In reply to üí´]
We are just discussing things :) right now we talk about existence and nonexistence at the same time. And I said that everything and nothing is more or less the same (since all is one) but so far Pella doesn't want to agree with me on that ^^

üí´, [22.10.16 17:35]
But, we can also safely assume that the universe doesn't make it's decisions until the very last moment.

Milena, [22.10.16 17:36]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ok so you think you know what reality is?

üí´, [22.10.16 17:36]
Reality doesn't exist at the microscopic level, though.

Milena, [22.10.16 17:37]
[In reply to üí´]
Here yo bring up time....and time yeah..doesn't really exist :D So all the decisions are already made before and after they are made üòÜ

Milena, [22.10.16 17:37]
[In reply to Milena]
quantum particles even go back in time and stuff....

Chris Spurs, [22.10.16 17:37]
[In reply to Milena]
And do we really have free will then?

üí´, [22.10.16 17:38]
[In reply to Milena]
Time is merely a concept, indeed. 
Time passes when changes take place, and when everything has attained equilibrium, time would've stopped then.

Milena, [22.10.16 17:39]
[In reply to Chris Spurs]
Hahaha awesome question :D the answer is yes and no. But no, not the way we think we do ^^ I recommend watching the movie "frequencies", it trys to give another perspective to this questions.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:40]
[In reply to Milena]
I know what reality is. Is what is influenced by me and around me that makes a change that can be perceived by an other.

Chris Spurs, [22.10.16 17:40]
I don't want to imagine the implications of having no free will.. üò™

Milena, [22.10.16 17:41]
[In reply to Chris Spurs]
I know :/ The first time I had an awakening on this I cried so much. But don't worry, you do have a will and it's more or less free to, but just on a whole other level when you think ^^ It goes beyond ego and that's why this realization hurts a little.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:41]
[In reply to Chris Spurs]
Yes! You take decision based on your mind, this is free will, you have choices that you take and you're free to take them like "do I take a shit now or later?"

Milena, [22.10.16 17:45]
I have to bring up this quote again

Milena, [22.10.16 17:45]
[Forwarded from Milena]
I have an interesting quote here, it's a transcript from the movie "Waking Life":
"I keep thinking about something you said.
Something I said?
Yeah. About how you often feel like you're observing your life from the perspective of an old woman about to die. You remember that?
Yeah. I still feel that way sometimes. Like I'm looking back on my life. Like my waking life is her memories.
Exactly. I heard that Tim Leary said as he was dying that he was looking forward to the moment when his body was dead but his brain was still alive. You know they say that there's still six to twelve minutes of brain activity after everything else is shutdown. And a second of dream consciousness, right, well, that's infinitely longer than a waking second. You know what I'm saying?
Oh, yeah, definitely. For example, I wake up and it is 10:12, and then I go back to sleep and I have those long, intricate, beautiful dreams that seem to last for hours, and then I wake up and it's ... 10:13.
Yeah, exactly. So then six to twelve minutes of brain activity, I mean, that could be your whole life. I mean, you are that woman looking back over everything.
Okay, so what if I am? Then what would you be in all that?
Whatever I am right now. I mean, yeah, maybe I only exist in your mind. I'm still just as real as anything else.
Yeah. I've been thinking also about something you said.
What's that?
Just about reincarnation and where all the new souls come from over time. Everybody always say that they've been the reincarnation of Cleopatra or Alexander the Great. I always want to tell them they were probably some dumb fuck like everybody else. I mean, it's impossible. Think about it. The world population has doubled in the past 40 years, right? So if you really believe in that ego thing of one eternal soul, then you have only 50% chance of your soul being over 40. And for it to be over 150 years old, then it's only one out of six.
Right, so what are you saying? That reincarnation doesn't exist, or that we're all young souls like where half of us are first round humans?
No, no. What I'm trying to say is that somehow I believe reincarnation is just a - a poetic expression of what collective memory really is. There was this article by this biochemist that I read not long ago, and he was talking about how when a member of our species is born, it has a billion years of memory to draw on. And this is where we inherit our instincts.
I like that. It's like there's this whole telepathic thing going on that we're all a part of, whether we're conscious of it or not. That would explain why there are all these, you know, seemingly spontaneous, worldwide, innovative leaps in science, in the arts. You know, like the same results poppin' up everywhere independent of each other. Some guy on a computer, he figures something out, and then almost simultaneously a bunch of other people all over the world figure out the same thing. They did this study. They isolated a group of people over time, and they monitored their abilities at crossword puzzles, right, in relation to the general population. And they secretly gave them a day-old crossword, one that had already been answered by thousands of other people, right. And their scores went up dramatically, like 20 percent. So it's like once the answers are out there, people can pick up on 'em. It's like we're all telepathically sharing our experiences."

[In reply to Milena]
Btw I wanted to ask something purely philosophical.
What happen after death.
This little movie transcript is actually bringing up some of my reasonments but then goes far away with reincarnation and collective memory. Those are concepts far beyond my question.
So first of all what will happen when we die? Well our brain will have a total shut down, let's assume a grenade, so nothing physical will be present in a matter of microseconds.
Now I think that dying might be similar to falling asleep. When we sleep a part from sporadic dreams (but let's not consider them for a moment) we don't remember to have slept.
We do remember before and after. But we have no idea what happened in between! The universe might have disappeared and reappeared in our sleep that we won't really realize it.
Now I think we can't exist, or our I can't exist without consciousness. Simply we disappear, and death will be the same like falling asleep we disappear, now we have a problem tho, after sleep our I reappears, but after dead for an infinite amount of time we will not wake up again so where does our I go?

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 17:56]
[In reply to Milena]
Lol üòÇ although the holographic universe theories stems from Descartes, you know that?

Milena, [22.10.16 17:57]
Btw, here is the attempt to answer our previous questions from my friend:
"So it's crazy/irrational to say 1=0, 0=1, or 1=Infinity, or 0=infinity. The only way that 1 could possibly equal 0 is if we are deducing the numerical properties of the same entity from different view points, or dimensions.
So, as an example, we have an apple. A single real apple. So Apple=1..... But how could 1=infinity??? How could that Apple be infinite?
And the answer is that i can cut the apple in half, making two pieces. Then in half again, making 4 pieces. And so on. Although this is an exponential growth, we could just as easily cut it into two pieces, then 3 pieces, then 4 (in a linear progression instead of exponential as in the previous example). Through doing this, we begin to face that we must now define the apple in terms of potential infinite variations in which is pieces can be parced. Thus we recognize that (1) apple has a)potentially infinite pieces that can be withdrawn, or separated, from it and 2) that there are potentially infinite methods of parcing as well... this allows us to derive two functional infinities from a single whole. 
So the way we were able to assert that 1=Infinity is by looking at the apple from different dimension; which we have done in a VERY rudimentary sense since we have not defined the boundaries that we are operating from as we describe properties of the apple (except for the basic dimensional definitions of linear and exponential as we parced the apple). So now to explore how the apple=0, or 1=0, we are faced with a couple of main options. 1) that as the apple exists as a fruit of a tree (which is a larger whole than the individual apple), we can recognize that it is less than 1 in relation to the system that produced it (the tree which creates many apples). Yet can we get to 0??? It seems not. Yet there is another dimensional trick we can pull. Specifically, if we measure the apple in terms of its fundamental wave energies, then we can see that there is actually no coherent mass implicit to the apple when viewing it outside it's supporting environment of condensed mayer, thus is actually 0 in terms of its own self coherency...."

Milena, [22.10.16 17:59]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Very good question. And I agree to most of what you say. But yes, we have again to question something else first, which is "what and who is "I"? And no, it's not as easy as you said last time and you know that too ^^

This is cool, and it has a direct source to the nature journal!

[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
And here is the nature journal
"Our experiment confirms Bohr‚Äôs view that it does not make sense to ascribe the wave or particle behaviour to a massive particle before the measurement takes place"
Now this is the main article conclusion
No time, future and past really addressed

Milena, [22.10.16 18:01]
Ah I see. There where also other experiments that proof them wrong, but that where not physical ones. Let me see if I can find them.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:01]

[In reply to Milena]
Ok, the thing makes sense but really you're assuming so many paradigms that let's be clear Milena you can't explain. So you technically are blindly believing in it. 
Moreover I define the apple as one, not in hoe many pieces I can cut it up, and if I wanted to consider the wave ground state I would have done it in the premise. Now all in all the apple itself is one, can be an infinite and can be a zero, given some observational parameters.üòë but I can't put in a program coding 
Apple = 1; and then expecting it to behave as an infinite or even as a zero. 
It depends everything from the measuring conditions, said very well in the text brought by your friend.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:08]
[In reply to Milena]
Dont worry

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:09]
You're doing something fundamentally wrong.  You're looking for truths... truth doesn't exist, time is relative and reality exists only when we measure it and perceive it.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:09]
When you hear 1 equals infinity equals zero, in you some kind of cosmic energy enters and you're there woah this concept blows my mind.

Milena, [22.10.16 18:10]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes, but you are making the same mistake I think ^^ because it exists and doesn't exist, it's always both

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:10]
But if you want a faith, that will tell humans the fundamental of ethics, you have to start by observing humans.

Milena, [22.10.16 18:11]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes but this os what was important for you, for me it was something slightly different ^^

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:11]
[In reply to Milena]
Truth doesn't üòë cause truth is an utopic concept, and irrelevant to the reality that we live in. There's always many faucets of truth, so many that stopped existing as a concept

Milena, [22.10.16 18:12]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Like reality is an utopic concept

Milena, [22.10.16 18:12]
actually everything is just a concept

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:12]
[In reply to Milena]
I mean this is what is important for me, becuse is practical, the rest we are discussing here is product of fantasy

Milena, [22.10.16 18:12]
and we choose it to be real or not

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:12]
Reality is a definition üòê
Truth is a concept
Reality can't be utopic because is tangible and perciveable

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:15]
Given a set of rules you can do whatever you want
The difficult thing is "keep it real"
Keep it connected to modern science
Keep it rigorous
Keep it in a frame that is not fantasy
Ofc behind me where I can't see. My room can disassemble in a space ship
Or in the absolute void
Or materializing the totatility of universe what even is
But the point is, that if I turn around
I'll see my room

Milena, [22.10.16 18:18]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
This depends on what you are doing with it. I would like to discuss your topic but my problem is that you are assuming some things as real and true, that aren't...and that's the same that you tell me when I'm trying to explain you exactly this. But ok I will try to address what you want to talk about as practical as possible, but not today, that's for sure. Maybe someone else would like to discuss that with you :) Have a nice day everyone.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:19]
[In reply to Milena]
Uhm... I told you in the beginning. What you have are mere fantasies and maybe dreams that you hide behind something called philosophy. üòë

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:19]
I see in you me 5 years ago
Exploring the 4 dimensions and the implications they have
I explored them also mathematically making a 4 dimensional snake game
Yet I've come now to the conclusion that some stuff can't be explained, some other can be addressed and others are only a game for the mind,  like the 4 euclidean geometrical dimension

Milena, [22.10.16 18:24]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ok what should I answer to this? Of course I don't agree :) 
Actually everything I am saying comes from "All is one". It's not fantasy but logic. To me you are not rigorous. But this is not leading us anywhere, if we just say that the other one isn't right and we are, it's not how we get to understand and learn from each other, it's just the usual ego game and I find it sometimes difficult to not play it with you to be honest :/ I'm really trying but yeah, whenever you say something like this it makes it really difficult.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:26]
I'm really trying to understand what you mean by all is one
But wit the same definition all could be 1.2345 or pi
So idek where to start

Milena, [22.10.16 18:27]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Thank you. I believe we are both not that far away from each other, we just need to find the right words and where our perspectives meet :)

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 18:27]
I think so but I'm afraid
I'm afraid that your theories are bound with esoterism and I'm trying to make a human religion, based on human behavior more than cosmical enlightenment

Milena, [22.10.16 18:29]
But this is an eternal conversation anyway :) I appreciate that you are having it with me. I decided to try to address your needs and the level you want to talk about things more. So the next time we can talk about you ethical problem and later someday about why and how all is one.

Milena, [22.10.16 18:29]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes I understood that :)

Milena, [22.10.16 18:31]
[In reply to Milena]
and leave the rest out as far and long as possible, but I believe we can't get around it completly, because it's all correlated...but we will find a way üëçüèº

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 19:27]
Just one thing... maybe makes more clear my way of thinking.
For example free will I say we have a choice, because at the moment of choice I make a decision which path to take.
Now if a presence decided that choice for me beforehand negating my free will, but I can't see nor interact with this presence then does that presence exist or not? Does the answer will help me with the choice or not? Can I even influence that presence? If I can't then why should I worry of a presence that I can't be sure if is there or not, I'm not sure I can influence, and if I don't know about that presence the result is the same?

Milena, [22.10.16 19:40]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Is it? Try to shift you focus and to find answers for the opposite.

### Consciousness
Chris Spurs, [22.10.16 20:04]
Hey

Chris Spurs, [22.10.16 20:04]
I have been wondering, what are we really? A collection of atoms conscious of itself? How? When we die, does this collection of atoms still recognize itself? What is consciousness? 
A thousand questions in my mind.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 20:15]
[In reply to Milena]
Why should I even question it if I can't really prove it? Nor change it.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 20:23]
[In reply to Chris Spurs]
We are humans. We are composed, after the modern science, of strings, quark, leptons, cells, tissues, organs,...

We concluded that the brain is responsible of our thoughts, from there thoughts are generated and affect how we move and interact with the environment. What is consciousness is a big question, I know that is in the prefrontal lobe of the brain, the biggest lobe Btw. We know is there because if you puncture it you lobotomize people.
Now consciousness is a collection of thoughts, stored in neuronal circuits, that allow ourself to recognize what is ours, what is something else, where we can walk and not, what is right and wrong, ... Consciousness and how the brain work are really complex and not everything science can explain rn, here Milena can give you more information on what is possible.

When we die what happens to our consciousness? Many are the interpretations, from the biblical ones showing an afterlife, the Indian and Buddhist giving space to a reincarnation, to the one analyzed by Philipp Pullman in the golden compass trilogy of going back and fuse with the nature itself, with the everything and realize of being part of it. 

I personally am still trying to figure it out, but as far as is now is a mere philosophical question which have really no answer.

Pella Jiriya, [22.10.16 20:27]
A very wise old man said "death must be a beautiful place, because nobody ever came back!"

Comrade "–ñ" Joshua, [23.10.16 02:27]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Well... Exactly. Consciousness is in the brain so when the brain stops (death) does not then consciousness die with it? Personally I think it does. I don't believe in an afterlife and instead do think that death is permanent and final.

Milena, [23.10.16 11:56]
I disagree. Consciousness is NOT created in the brain. The brain is already the creation of consciousness since all matter is created by concsiousness (and simultaneously part of consciousness itself). Remember the holographic universe stuff etc. it all comes together to this conclusion. 

I like to use the dream metaphor to make it easier to understand. If you dream you perceive yourself in a body and you identify with this body. You also experience yourself separate from all other "people" in you dream, but in reality they are all coming from your consciousness, there is no separation and you are not limited to your "physical" body, you are the one who created the "imagination" of it. And reality works pretty much the same. That's why I'm always trying to explain that who you really are is not limited to your ego, it's far beyond that! 
Ok I know some of you might want to disagree on this but try to think in a bigger concept and make some research on this. I have two articles that I found very quick for you, but you can find a ton more. 

"‚ÄúLooking for consciousness in the brain is like looking in the radio for the announcer.‚Äù ‚Äì Nasseim Haramein, director of research for the Resonance Project

‚ÄúI regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.‚Äù  ‚Äì  Max Planck, theoretical physicist who originated quantum theory, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918

‚ÄúIt was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness.‚Äù  Eugene Wigner, theoretical physicist and mathematician. He received a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963

"... the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter, we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter. Get over it, and accept the inarguable conclusion. The universe is immaterial-mental and spiritual.‚Äù  ‚Äì R.C. Henry,Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University ,  ‚ÄúThe Mental Universe‚Äù"

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:33]
Uh....

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:33]
First of all this doesn't explain lobotomy at all.

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:34]
Doesn't explain the obliteration of consciousness after the brain is damaged

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:34]
So yes every thoughts generates in the brain

Milena, [23.10.16 12:35]
You can also dream of a lobotomy and experience the effects

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:36]
I have my opinions about dreams... which is really far from yours

Milena, [23.10.16 12:36]
Such an experience is just part of your created "dream". You also wrote the rules for this reality.

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:37]
You can't dream about lobotomy... üòë because you can't reach the status of the non existence of the I...

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:39]
[In reply to Milena]
We need to convey on something tho, even tho everything might be part of a hologram created by our mind, this hologram has specific rules... you can't imagine things and make them appear for others. You have to make them appear using the laws of universe.

Milena, [23.10.16 12:42]
And a lobotomy or mental illness or whatever is the same like destroying a radio. It does not destroy the announcer.

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:42]
Moreover the citation you bring by those great scientists are basically true.
But is different than the meaning that you plaster to it.

First of there's still a open debate about the need of a consciousness to create the universe and is due to fact about the consequciality of the random fluctuations of the space time fabric to create the universe. 

Some people believe that there's a intent and a will that promote the creation of the universe, some others thinks is only the randomness.

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:43]
[In reply to Milena]
But the announcer can't speak anymore then... and you can't see the announcer... so you end up again in a self contained problem where you can't demostrate that the announcer is there, neither you can demostrate is not there

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:44]
This is the big problem behind your philosophy.

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:44]
You take something, say there's something we can't demostrate behind it, and plan a theory built on that.

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:48]
I hate to break it to you... but first of all you assume there's a right way to interpret things, when there's at least 2 ways to interpret it.

Second your way of choosing the right way is completely biased, and make sense in your mind, but not in all minds.

Your interpretation moreover is strongly based on fantasy, non real facts, non tangible and non demostrable. 

I can come up with other 5 theories that have the same values as yours with completely different morals.

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:49]
Again... why do I have to spend time to search for the announcer, when I can't proof is there?  I can't influence it, I can't interact with it. So why should I spend time and energy trying to see it?

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 12:50]
Btw I agree that in future we might be able to see it, right now we can't

[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ok you are right. If you want to know and understand only what you see then yes, you could say it's not there when you don't see it. It's definitely not the way I  think about it but I agree that many do. But as much as I try to address your level of perception I still can't be a completely different person than I am. So I will deal with the way you see things and you will sometimes have to deal with the way I see them. I also agree when you say that I assume that there is one right way and I'm honest with you, I do and I believe in one universal truth, but I shouldn't force it onto others and part of this truth also is that all is true to someone. So try to see everything I say as theory, you can take what you like and ignore the rest if you want. Unfortunately i won't have much time to have proper discussions the next few weeks, so I will be just throwing in some information every now and then, sorry for that in advance.

Milena, [23.10.16 15:45]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
You see and this is where you are wrong and why I told you that you need to connect to your soul more. You can interact with this consciousness, you can also operate through it and basically you can change absolutely the whole reality, yes even the collective, by doing so. But it is pretty difficult and as long as you are not open to it and can't even see how it would benefit your life too it's not gonna happen. But the funny thing is that you are asking those questions because unconsciously you know that it is exactly what you need and desire... But your ego conscious mind tells you differently ^^ no matter what you decide tho and which path you choose it will be always the right decision for you and your soul. 
And this group is really not meant to discuss only "what we can see or measure", therefore there are a lot of other groups on Telegram üòÖ So please excuse me and others when some "fantastic" subjects and theories are brought up, since your way of thinking about all that is also just one of many options ;)

I like how you think! Truly! And I love your explanations, you are very well informed, and you express your way in a very nice way, without imposing. 

I have an idea, I have a
Something I want to bring forward. I want to create a new religion!

I want to create a modern religion, what I want to do is a humongous project. I'm not sure I'll be able to do it.
I want to introduce, rythes, traditions, common guidelines, and build basically everything from scratch.

I came to the realization that religions are good and influence the thought and life of many people! Although the 3 Abrahamic religions have something very wrong in them. They are based on the interpretation of a book or series of books written ages ago.
The principle that are written in those books were life changer and saver in the antiquity but in modern times have lost most of the significance.

We need new and modern concept and we need a dynamic book, something like Wikipedia that constantly evolves to be at the pair of times.

My objective is also the one to create something that everyone can agree upon, something fundamental to the human specie. 
Thus I don't completely discard your hypothesis, which are nice and colorful. But the project needs to be wider, including all the paths, not just one, the book must analyze concretely the human behavior and have take home message that are good for each one of us. 

This is why I want to keep it human centric, it will be a religion made by humans, for the humans.

The day we will encounter extraterrestrial we will have to change dramatically the religion, but now the most important to me is humanity and the progress as a specie!

THE BOOK OF MYSTERIES BY JONATHAN CAHN

[In reply to Milena]
Water... this is a good example! You want to taste the pure and crystalline water, the final essence of it. You want to find an absolute water.
You see that religion package water in a different way and propose it to you, but you don't want this, you want to understand what's water at the source.

But even in your spiritual awekening you admit that everything is a matter of perception and how you define it.  Everything can be nothing and nothing can be everything, what matters is how we, both as a collective consciousness, soul or ego, perceive what water is and how do we define it.

Chemically water is H2O, but socially many types of things are referred as water, something flowing in a river. The crystalline water of a mountain lake and the turbid water of the Amazon river,  the salty water of the ocean, and the water stored in a pet bottle. As you can see there's no real truth behind what is really water! 
There's people that have the job to taste water like wine, depending on the ion concentration water changes taste, but wait... water in chemistry is tasteless, how can this be?

This multitude of definitions, is what I want to try to make them into a comprehensive text that will guide us through them.

I don't discard any hypothesis although I don't want to collapse my brain quantum waves into one single definition!

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 16:46]
[In reply to James David]
I tell you why and what pushed me to create one.
I'm an individualist, and I started to detach from the religion I was brought up with when I was about 16-20.

"Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called "an order of existence"."

This is the Wikipedia definition of religion. As you can see there's nothing defined as dogmatic, divine, and the major religion of today are a subset of this definition. Religion brings a stygma of being bigot and closed, but in the definition of it nothing in this way is really stated.

Milena, [23.10.16 17:10]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Yes yes right, but also my vision says that there is ONE truth, one source but no matter how we get to it, no matter how we perceive it and how different that perception appears to be at the first sight, it still is always the same truth üòÑ

Pella Jiriya, [23.10.16 18:00]

That is what I'm really not sure about. Most of the religions bring the concept of one truth... but this leads to inevitable paradoxes...

Do you have a name in mind for your new religion...

Pella Jiriya, [24.10.16 14:06]
[In reply to Leonard Greenpaw]
Religion doesn't have to have a deity... 
So technically considers a paradigm of existence and non existence of any self contained super natural power.

Pella Jiriya, [24.10.16 14:09]
[In reply to James David]
Me? Not really, I called it Schr√∂dinger religion, because of the duality of existence of a deity. Vexanesim because they analyze in the movie the presence and non presence at the same time of something.
I called if pellanesim since I'm the only follower, I wanted to call it ratio, from rationalism, but rationalism brought to extreme is dangerous and counterproductive.

Pella Jiriya, [24.10.16 14:13]
I wanted it to be an atheist religion, but I have to recognize that some people need the presence of a deity. Since one of the fundamental objectives of my religion would be coexistence I can't exclude a priori the presence of a deity. 

Moreover it's impossible to demostrate the presence of a deity but also impossible to demonstrate the absence. Thus my conclusion of the existence and non existence at the same time.

In this non significant poll we can see that there's still a lot of people who say that it exist or don't know if it exists.

Being upfront atheist would be completely wrong, since my religion wants to be for humanity, the religion can't simply ignore the basic human need for a deity!

Leonard Greenpaw, [24.10.16 16:50]
I take a vastly different approach. My religion is anti theist. It says that whether or not a deity exists is not the right question, the right question is "so what?" 
As you said the first question is unanswerable, in such cases I teach that we should evaluate the effects of all possible answers.
Thankfully this is a yes or no. If no, then we are alone and have to do things ourselves and fix our own issues collectively speaking.... If yes, its the same because if a deity does exist it is a clockwork creator, that is to say he either doesn't care about us or doesn't have power over our reality. We see this as self evident with every single loss of life and the constant pain and suffering in this world at every moment. An amoral god doesn't deserve worship, it doesn't help worshipping a powerless god, and its a waste of time worshipping a god that isn't omniscient.


Basically i take the 'problem of evil' exercise and come out with 'fuck god'

As a result my religion teaches people to be their own gods, we have the greatest individual control over our lives and see should learn to embrace our individual and collective potential.

Yet... faith gives the power to blow them self up, to WALK from France to Jerusalem

Pella Jiriya, [24.10.16 18:31]
Moreover some people feel the presence of God

Pella Jiriya, [24.10.16 18:32]
Is an innate need to recognize and require the presence of a higher order.

Pella Jiriya, [24.10.16 18:32]
If you want to make a religion for the people you can't ignore this feeling

Pella Jiriya, [24.10.16 18:33]
And I can tell you is present in at least 70% of the population, between agnostics and believers.

Pella Jiriya, [24.10.16 18:34]
So your reasonment commits a huge fallacy to trample over the innate desire to have a deity.

Pella Jiriya, [24.10.16 18:35]
I personally share your opinions, and I found a paradigm of life devoided from a deity. But I can't deny that my father who believes is worthy and brings valuable arguments to the presence of a God.

I believe in an objective truth of the universe that exists independent of an entities perception. If a tree falls in thewoods, does it make a sound? Yes it will still vibrate the air with a resonance that we call a sound
We can only view this objective reality through the coloured lens of our subjective mind. It is a goal of science to try to determine what that raw reality looks like

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 00:31]
[In reply to Leonard Greenpaw]
We can only view this objective reality through the coloured lens of our subjective mind. 

This pretty much says why a fundamental truth, an objective truth is not existing. Since the only way we have to find it is through perception.

The only thing we can do is trace a way to think that will allow us to have a high coherent reproducibility! (Like for example the scientific method)

Leonard Greenpaw, [25.10.16 05:14]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
There is a difference between something being real but unable to be perceived, and  that thing not being real.

Plus perception is only a variable the more directly you look at something, there are ways to look at something indirectly in order to more clearly see the objectivity of it.

Reality is s difficult concept

david davidson, [25.10.16 09:47]
Reality is what is, when you stop believing in, doesn't change. 

-Philip K Dick

Will, [25.10.16 10:20]
Perception organs of your sense the reality you live in. 
The mind organised and tries to make a reason for why things are the way they are, often discarding scientific evidence in its absence. 

We try to make sense of our existence when there is none. Only a product of a few billion years of evolution which humans managed to by pass their limited survival time. 

If there is even the slightest possibility that humans are the only organisms that made through the filtering mesh of lowest survival probability. Then it falls to us to defy our limits and turn into pioneers of an entirely new reality. 
A battle is being fought and the odds are against us, be it energy efficiency, resource depletion or misuse , pollution , political quests for power for selfish reasons. The odds are against us. 
And we are at the frontier of it all and responsibility falls on us to either have our species transcend into something entirely new or fade into oblivion. 
Be gods or be gone.

Will, [25.10.16 10:25]
And as for why should we... 
The answer is as simple as it gets.
Because we can.

Will, [25.10.16 10:43]
Yes surely. 
You can apply the same reasoning to degradation of society just because you can. 
But do you really want your children or the future generations in a dystopia when instead you could be building them the playground to play they deserve to progress humanity. 

Answering that you aren't going to be alive to see that won't work as you would become the scape goat for an entire civilization to blame for being myopic to only waste their lives as well as theirs.

Reality is a matter of perception. 
The interaction with others builds reality, but we can never be sure.

Like I can't demostrate that behind me the world isn't collapsing and rebuilding just before I turn.

But someone else with an other perspective can tell you what's behind. But still it is limited to its perception.

We can only try to build and try to explain reality with the most logical way possible.

This human interaction might build the collective intellect that Milena is talking about. 

Because through collectivism we can define a reality, a reality shared by many.

Although we will never be able to construct an absolute reality, because we can't escape the human way to transmit information.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 11:19]
[In reply to Will]
"If there is even the slightest possibility that humans are the only organisms that made through the filtering mesh of lowest survival probability. "

I really don't get this tbh.

Will, [25.10.16 12:28]
You see there have been extinctions throughout history. Some allocated to a specific geographical area some to an global extent. Somehow we have dodged one and are still living thanks to our opposable thumbs and intellect . 

BUT the question is after we have built our selves a safe environment to live in what purpose do we serve because we have well surpassed our natural expiry date. 

Now there are generally two sides of how we perceive humans and intelligence. 

One is a spectrum which goes 
Fish:apes :: apes : Humans :: humans : an extremely smart species accommodated to be tier 3 organisms. 
There is a gradation here which is pretty reasonable but then Fermi paradox hits us in the face.

Now the second one is more frightening because it proposes that humans are the embodiment of "shit we got lucky , what do we do now" 
There are no smarter species because of how hostile the universe is to life, be it a human or other species. 
Now if that probability is correct then our chances of survival were already low and we got the chance to do the best we can to pioneer whatever means we have to make life sustainable and possible. Which means making our consciousness a broader spread in the universe. 

Basically , somehow we passe the filtration mesh for extinction of species and life and now are responsible for figuring out a way to life more enduring .

Different fields. But yes. Both equally necessary.

Politics isn't my cup of tea.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:27]
[In reply to Will]
So you want equality not equity?

Will, [25.10.16 13:28]
Equity for what.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:29]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Equality gives to everyone the same support, equity helps people differently to achieve the same result

Will, [25.10.16 13:29]
Don't hesitate. It's a genuine question.

Will, [25.10.16 13:30]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
The same result. Expound on that for me.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:32]
[In reply to Will]
In that picture the end result is being able to watch the game 

As a help is given a box to every one, regardless of the height of the person.

While equity gives boxes considering the inherent human differences

Will, [25.10.16 13:32]
Yes. But why the need for the same result for everyone.

Will, [25.10.16 13:33]
Taking our examples.

Will, [25.10.16 13:33]
You would go into different field than me.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:33]
Questioning ourself about this concepts is for me practically more useful then discussing if there's a collective intellect or not.

Will, [25.10.16 13:33]
Providing the same tools. But notable all tools would be more important.

Will, [25.10.16 13:33]

So what is your idea and criticism of mine.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:36]
I don't have really an idea

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:37]
But I came to the conclusion that the sentence equal opportunity doesn't mean much

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:37]
I know what you mean ofc

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:37]
You want that people would have the same starting conditions.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:38]
Although in practice, equal opportunity for me is not appliable because we aren't equal.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:39]
But I also don't agree with equity, in a way that would create a differential resource management

Will, [25.10.16 13:39]
In the longer run you would have leechers on a system .

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:39]
So we need to kind of create an ad hoc system

Will, [25.10.16 13:40]
Equity initially is a bliss but turns into a blunder once people figure out a way for it to work in their advantage.

Will, [25.10.16 13:41]
Its a divergent path. But the end goal isn't the same for everyone because everyone is specialised to form and contemplate their own niche.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:43]
I think we should concentrate more on finding which niece each human fits more than giving everybody equal opportunity.

Will, [25.10.16 13:44]
Yes. Equal opportunity and resources.

Will, [25.10.16 13:44]
So you can fund yourself into becoming who you are into. But then again neuroplasticity plays a bigger role in this debate.

Will, [25.10.16 13:44]
Humans are adaptable.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:45]
And opportunity implies equity tbh

Will, [25.10.16 13:45]
Well. It does if not referring to the photo

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:46]
So you want everybody to technically be able to have the same opportunity.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:46]
So you need to give a bit more to somebody with a disvantage

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:46]
While give less to somebody with an advantage

Will, [25.10.16 13:46]
Well no.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:46]
So you'll have equal opportunity, meaning equal potential for achievement

Will, [25.10.16 13:47]
Imagine it this way. There is a building for you. In that building there are multiple doors. 
You are handed the keys to every one of them. And you have the liberty to go to the path that you like.

Will, [25.10.16 13:48]
But you would be given a test run for what the concepts behind the doors lie. And hence would be more educated to make a more rational judgement

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:48]
I have a broken leg.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:48]
Should society provide a help to climb the stairs?

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:49]
Or be treated equal and give just the key and go fuck yourself?

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:50]
Is it really equal opportunity? If we give the cripple the same help as somebody healthy?

Will, [25.10.16 13:51]
Crippled in the terms of having suffered I justice and discrimination in the past or something more profound like disabilities to perform basic functions of life.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:52]
Crippled in the sense that can't perform the task of climbing the stairs and open the doors past the first floor

Will, [25.10.16 13:54]
I am losing you in the analogy.

Will, [25.10.16 13:54]

They encourage effort, instead of using ties.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:57]
[In reply to Will]
Is it still equal opportunity, if you give all the keys to the rooms in the building to a healthy man and a man with a broken leg?  

Wouldn't the healthy man be able to reach for more doors? Wouldn't the cripple be limited? Shall we as society compensate for this disability so that there will be equity?

Stefan, [25.10.16 13:57]
Bad analogy.

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:57]
Uhm?

Pella Jiriya, [25.10.16 13:57]

Think of the colored glasses of perception as deviations on a scatterplot statastics chart. When you take a large number of glasses, they will deviat to both sides of the expected projection, but they will do a reversion to the mean, the statisical average will have a very large probablility to revert to the theoretical average. This is more true as more and more people start learning how to  adapt beyond their biases as best they can i.e. science
In other words, the average of general perception is /highly likely/ to grow closer to objective reality as time moves on

Leonard Greenpaw, [25.10.16 17:32]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
-looks it up- 
Eusociality (Greek eu: "good/real" + "social"), the highest level of organization of animal sociality, is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative brood care (including brood care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an animal society which are sometimes called castes. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste.

I don't agree in the human race being special in contrast to the other animals because we also follow many of the science designed rules.

Moreover I think that humans are different so an equality is difficult to reach. Giving everybody the same would put people with a disadvantage in second place (if is right this goes toward social darwinism). I don't find either equity a good solutions since I'm convinced that not everybody can reach the same goal.

Yes, yes it would, Earth as the collective living organisms is a 'live planet' as opposed to a dead planet devoid of life. Refering to its physical form as being its entirety is like saying if your body would care if I stab you in the brain, Most of your physical form will be pretty much fine, it just will cease living

Lelz let's take self defined communist or strongly socialist economies and say they are not communist since we need a new definition of communism to make it work.

Oh god those are technicalities that aren't inherent to the answer.  I meant endurance, with running fast, I'm sorry.

I meant climbing trees to escape predators, not as a main motile purpose.

I don't agree in the human race being special in contrast to the other animals because we also follow many of the science designed rules.

Moreover I think that humans are different so an equality is difficult to reach. Giving everybody the same would put people with a disadvantage in second place (if is right this goes toward social darwinism). I don't find either equity a good solutions since I'm convinced that not everybody can reach the same goal.

A tailored solution has to be found like you, Will, said that we need to find individual niches.
