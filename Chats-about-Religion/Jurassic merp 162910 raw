Ugh

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:12]
Doesnt work like that

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:12]
Im afraid to talk with u about my religion pella

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:12]
U might steal it

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:12]
Change words

he is a friend of mine w are like brothers and more

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:12]
And said u made it

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:12]
[In reply to Fernando Moreno]
Nope

[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Id rather start my own thread or religion of whatever this bs is, if i do it at all...

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:13]
You will still have yours written

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:13]
Is a platform done to avoid stealing and equal contribution

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:13]
I might check it later

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:13]
[In reply to Samir]
Yes that's the point you can take my religion

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:13]
But i expect a lot of bullshit from that site

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:13]
Cuz

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:13]
Theres crazy ppl out there

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:13]
Erase everything and write on it

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:14]
Let's see after is the two things can be merged

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:14]
[In reply to Fernando Moreno]
That's the point. I chose github to avoid trolls

thug boy, [29.10.16 03:14]
ohh i think im fucking my sleep

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:14]
Dude u are legit triggering me

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:14]
Like Wikipedia is prone to trolls

Fernando Moreno, [29.10.16 03:14]
Its hard to trigger me on the internet

thug boy, [29.10.16 03:14]
bye bye fuckers

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:14]
But github has a sense of propriety

Samir, [29.10.16 03:15]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Lol its probably gonna stay that way too, everyone has individualized beliefs till they realize theyre not that different after all, but most people dont even know what they believe in or have it completely figured out anyways

Samir, [29.10.16 03:16]

Github maintains history of the files, and who contributed with what

[In reply to Samir]
hahaha

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:17]

That's why I created a github to freely discuss about it in an organized manner

U can create a religion dude

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:17]
And if we will have the situation that everybody has is own self constructed religion is cool anyway

Samir, [29.10.16 03:18]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Ill check it out or whatever tomorrow, i didnt sleep tho i pulled an all nighter and my brain is slow rn

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:18]
I don't care how many followers I have. I'm not a missionary and I'm not here to convert people

[In reply to Fernando Moreno]
No Lmao , What you can create is a sect though

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:18]

I see! Pm me when you do! Github is difficult to manage. But once learned is powerful

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:19]

Uhm?  What's the practical difference between a religion and a sect?

[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
A religion need a sacred text relating the ideology of the religion , a way of living , a metaphysic world

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:21]
[In reply to Samir]
This is acceptable in my religion since is a obvious joke.
Satire and humor are part of the human being

Math Wiz, [29.10.16 03:21]
While a sect has no sacred texts

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:21]
[In reply to Math Wiz]
I'm writing the sacred text, with your help too.

Math Wiz, [29.10.16 03:21]
Ooooh kk

Zai, [29.10.16 03:22]
ban gay from religion

Zai, [29.10.16 03:22]
so there won't be gays

Samir, [29.10.16 03:22]
[In reply to Math Wiz]
Why? This is kind of outdated no? Why does it NEED a "sacred text"? Cuz all the old organized religions had one?

Sacred or not I'm writing one so in Mathis made up categorization here we have a religion

Samir, [29.10.16 03:23]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
This is SO GENERAL though

Math Wiz, [29.10.16 03:23]
[In reply to Samir]
Samir. A religion is nothing without a sacred text. It's one of the criteria to make the difference between a sect and a religion

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:24]
[In reply to Samir]
Hey I founded it a couple of month ago...

Samir, [29.10.16 03:24]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Lolz

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:24]
[In reply to Samir]
But many of the things are also stuff you, Mathis and others in the chat said

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:24]
My thoughts convoluted, evolved and changed by crossing your paths

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:25]
Now is just a matter of materializing it

Samir, [29.10.16 03:25]
[In reply to Math Wiz]
I mean i guess but what if the religion was as simple as the ten commandments lets say... where it was so easily memorized that u wouldnt need a text...

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:25]
[ Photo ]
This is what I'm asking people

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:26]
[In reply to Samir]
Samir rises a very good point

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:26]
A religion can be verbal

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:26]
In fact Hinduism and Buddhism have been verbal for long time

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:27]
Btw Hinduism and Buddhism are similar to what I want to compose. They aren't reffering to one single text and in some region some texts are more important  then others

Samir, [29.10.16 03:28]
Merp, im just saying, it is more likely to be followed the easier you can remember it... so maybe my "sacred text" would be in songs form... consisting of maybe an album

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:28]
Why this fluidity? Doesn't it make weaker? Probably but allows a multiculturalization

Math Wiz, [29.10.16 03:28]
[In reply to Samir]
Well, the 10 commandments count as a religious text

It doesn't have to be hard to memorize , it just has to be something

Samir, [29.10.16 03:29]
[In reply to Math Wiz]
Lol idk im not beat for this rn... ill come back to this tomorrow

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:29]
Create a folder called the Schrodinger-religion-song and place it in your repository I'll implement in Pella religion if I like it!

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:30]
Btw about songs and ten commandaments

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:31]
This is an Italian song about the commandaments
https://telegram.me/joinchat/CvcIfEDjOPskQ1I7AHXGOQ

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:31]
I'm trying to expand on the deep concept they bring

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:32]
Btw this song was one of the triggers that brought me to have an atheist life style

Samir, [29.10.16 03:32]
Weird

Samir, [29.10.16 03:32]
I wont understand tho

Samir, [29.10.16 03:32]
Its italian

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:32]
I'm translating it

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:32]
To english in the best way I can

Samir, [29.10.16 03:32]
Oh god

Samir, [29.10.16 03:32]
Lmao

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:32]
And commenting on it

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:33]
This will be part of the Schrodinger-religion-extras üòâ

This is impossible tho... because one would disprove the other so.. how can both simultaneously exist?

Math Wiz, [29.10.16 03:47]

That's already a thing though , it's called being agnostic

Nope agnostics say I don't know! I say it exists and doesn't exist

[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
What it all comes down to... a meme lol

Math Wiz, [29.10.16 03:48]

Well, I think it's more about accepting that a god could exist or not , that they are both possible

That's what's revolutionary about Schr√∂dinger thinking

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:49]
He says the cat is both dead and alive in the box

Samir, [29.10.16 03:50]
For all u know there isnt even a cat in the box

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:50]
[In reply to Samir]
Yup... well you put it in

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:50]
So technically you have cat in a box

Sounds like a crock of shit

How can this be?

Until you measure it... you don't know

So you assume is both

Those guys in the 30ies brought so many humanity changing principles

G√∂del, saying that mathematics can't explain everything if it includes arithmetics

Samir, [29.10.16 03:54]
So because its hypothetical, it's plausible?

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:54]
Max plank gives limits on the measures! There's a minimal measure where after that a smaller distance doesn't make physically sense!

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:55]

Then if we go a bit further we run into the holographic universe theory, the matrix principle

So I think the measure is 10^-32

Samir, [29.10.16 03:56]
[In reply to Pella Jiriya]
Merp?

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:56]
10^-33 meters don't exist

Pella Jiriya, [29.10.16 03:56]
Because they break the laws of physics
