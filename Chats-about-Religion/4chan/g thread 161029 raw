Hello people!

I would like to show you a crazy idea I just had.
Making a new religion! The first (maybe) OpenSource religion in the world.

> The Schrödinger religion.
https://github.com/Pella86/Schrodinger-religion

> The religion itself:
https://github.com/Pella86/Schrodinger-religion/blob/master/The%20religion.md

> How do I contribute?
https://github.com/Pella86/Schrodinger-religion/blob/master/HowToContribute.md

I'm not looking for followers, neither people who agree with what I wrote, I'd love to discuss the idea first and foremost.
One can contribute to it even without being follower, because this religion gives the possibility to create your own.

> Religion Essentials

> Purpose
This religion is meant to be a way of achieving coexistence in the human species and to promote progress.

> Why the need of a new religion?
The main religions right now are based on old texts. All in all these texts are written in antiquity and don't take in account the fast pace of progression that society, over recent times, has undergone.

> How is the new religion different?
I want to create a modern religion, written socially by people. I want to create a dynamic sacred script that is modified with the discovery of new technologies. 

> God?
Schrödinger religion, will consider the hypothesis that atheism AND theism both exist at the same time.

Stance of the religion on Homosexuality:

> Choice or predisposition?
Homosexuality isn't a choice, like isn't a choice to be hetero. 

> Minoritarian behavior
One last thing, being gay will always be controversial in a population, since will always be an alternative behavior of the standard.

> Where the religion is stuck and needs your help
Is homosexuality harming today society? Is homosexual propaganda harming more? Should the society control sexual behavior of its members? If yes how?

Of course they both exist. There are theistic people and atheistic people. This is an observable fact.

If your religion can be debunked with basic first order logic, it is not a very good religion.

Yup, for example I'm an atheist, but I must admit that in through time I wasn't always atheist, when I was young I believed in God.

So if I consider myself through the history of time, I'm as a single person bearer of the duality concept.

This is what I'm talking about, I'm not a philosopher and I need help from people to build upon it.
If you would help me and adress where is the logical fallacy and where I can get better information I'll be glad to hear and thankful to you.

No. Theism is merely a practice. What's the point in making a religion out of the absence of a practice?

Pastafarianism is too openly ironic, we need plausible deniability.

"Something that will go toward LaVey said. Laveyian Satanism is an atheist religion, that promote the individualism and social Darwinism. [1] Although the idea of an atheist religion is very good, I don't find useful to completely refuse deities, since the majority of the population has the need of a supernatural being."

I'm not exactly sure what you mean with merely a practice, but atheistic religions have existed in the past and still are followed.

You don't need religion to coexist with other humans or to progress as a society. Religion usually impedes both of those things. 

You know how people can coexist and how progress can be made? With compassion, empathy, reason, and other secular values that have been known about and used for all of human history. 

>> Why the need of a new religion?
>The main religions right now are based on old texts. All in all these texts are written in antiquity and don't take in account the fast pace of progression that society, over recent times, has undergone.
Right. And they all disagree with eachother, because they all assert different interpretations of the same universe, typically with unproven or unfalsifiable claims.

How does creating another religion solve any of that? Even if it became successful, it isn't going to dissuade every believer from every other religion that exists.

>Schrödinger religion, will consider the hypothesis that atheism AND theism both exist at the same time.
Fucking retarded and nonsensical. When something unfalsifiable is said to exist, you don't somehow "believe" and "not believe" in it at the same time. You operate under the assumption that it doesn't exist, until proven otherwise.
