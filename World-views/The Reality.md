# Reality

It's a philosophical problem that has impact on many of the topics that here will be touched.

#### Summary in one line
"Reality manifests as the collective, human, experiential world in a lawful, stable, and consistent manner that, as our knowledge advances, is increasingly predictable, is independent of any individual's wishes and biases, and outlasts our deaths or lapses in consciousness." [1]
For now I'll take yoism view of reality which is in according with Bohr quantistic view of the world and disagree with Einstein realism.

## Niels Bohr vs Einstein Debate
Reality is what we percieve or exists a fundamental reality that is true?
