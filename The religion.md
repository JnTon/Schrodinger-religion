## The purpose of the Schrodinger religion
This religion is meant to be a way of achieving coexistence in the human species and to promote progress.
We will later define what is meant by progress and coexistence in more detail, but both terms should be taken in the literal form.
Progress[1]: Development towards an improved or more advanced condition.
Coexistence[2]: he state or condition of living in harmony despite different ideologies or interests.

## Why the need of a new religion
The main religions right now are based on old texts. Christianity has the biblical canon, namely the New and Old Testament,
Islam has the Qua'ran, Hinduism has Vedas and the Upanishads, although defining these texts as fundamental of Hinduism is incomplete
due to the diverse traditions of the religion. Buddhist, much like Hinduism has a variety of texts that for some are considered as
sacred, and for others, not sacred. All in all these texts are written in antiquity and don't take in account the fast pace of
progression that society, over recent times, has undergone.

[[4] wikipedia - Buddhist scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Buddhist_texts)

Modern religions try to adapt to this new era by means of reinterpreting the same scripts,
but by doing this they are committing a huge fallacy by reusing the old religious conception to try to fit them in the newer concepts.
This is also the reason of the decay of faith in the new century (Unproved statement). The new and wild reinterpretations create paradoxes
and splits each religion into subgroups. Although they are updated continuously by the work of the religious leaders,
this reinterpretation creates a fragmented ad hoc religion which doesn't reflect the original branch.
This causes the identity of a religion to fragments in many subgroups.  Christianity is divided in three main groups:
Roman Catholicism, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox. Muslims seem to convey that faith is more unitary and they recognize
themselves as part of something called ummah, which contains all the faucets of faith. Despite this unity,
there are subgroups like the Sunni and Shi'a, but also spawning from this religion are Wahhabi Islam or Nation of Islam.
Howard R. Greenstein takes the words of  Leo Trepp and identified six subgroups in Judaism. I'm sure that also the other major religions in the world have such fragmentation [1]. Hinduism and Buddhism are already a convolution of many traditions and rites[2].

##How is the new religion different
I want to create a modern religion, written socially by people, which can be a group or even anonymous.
I want to create a dynamic sacred script that is modified with the discovery of new technologies.
I don't want to completely refuse the old and sacred texts, because I'm sure they contain deep fundamentals of the human nature,
but I want population contribution towards writing a text that is for humans, written by humans.

To tell the truth: Well I'm not sure where this idea might bring
I just shot the flat stone on the lake.
But I don't know how many bounces it will make and if it even will reach the other side.
What I would like to make is really a comprehensive social media mediated religion that will maybe and possibily find the communication with the existing branches of religions.
Of course wants to bring in typical religion stuff, like rites and traditions, if they absorbed by the regional traditions or if they are completely invented from scratch we will see.
For now I'd like opinions and contributions.

##Satanism and the new religion
Something that will go toward LaVey said. Laveyian Satanism is an atheist religion, that promote the individualism
and social Darwinism. [1] Although the idea of an atheist religion is very good, I don't find useful to completely refuse deities,
since the majority of the population has the need of a supernatural being. Also, the culture of individualism and the culture of human
instincts is very good, if it is used to facilitate the interaction with other humans.
An anthropocentric view of the religion itself is a basic in the new religion,
albeit the human to desire for a deity or collective consciousness. These feelings must be considered when creating this dual religion.
However, in this religion those who may have completely refused the presence of a deity are accepted.

##Why don't we consider a Schrödinger religion?  
Schrödinger religion, will consider the hypothesis that atheism AND theism both exist at the same time.
The existence of the presence of a god discussion is mathematically proven to be a non-answerable question,
since neither side as far as of now can provide proof to the existence or the nonexistence. (source, Gödel and Sobel).
*(Gödel and Aquin define the principle of faith in God but aren't proof of it. Sobel critizises those principles.*
*Depending on the branch of philosophy there's ways to demontrate god presence. Just mathematics can't prove it.)*
Although it is a human need to believe in a super being, an order of things, a god or gods so to speak.
More than 80% of the population believes or is unsure about the presence of a god. [1]
This reflects a basic human need to cope with the apparent void meaning of life. Now God, or a super natural being
is a human mental construct. It is something the brain creates, something humans conceive and worship.
Now how can we make a religion that will encompass both ends? Perhaps a Schrödinger religion?
A religion that both considers the existence and nonexistence of deities.
