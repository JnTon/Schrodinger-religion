## Why the need of a new religion
The modern religions of the world (Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, ...) are all based on antique texts, some are considered sacred some are not.
The texts have been written in the ancient times, and don't take in account the fast pace of progression that society, over recent times, has undergone.
Modern religions try to adapt to our new era by means of reinterpreting the same scripts, the process of revaluation of fields of meaning has some inherent problems.
First the divergence from the literal interpretation is subjective and error prone.
Second the different interpretation might lead to a disruption of faith congruence.
Third it appears that it promote the fragmentation of the religion.
This might also be the reason of the decay of faith in the new century (Unproved statement). [1]

[[1] Summary of form the section Religion and old text of the Schrodinger religion](https://github.com/Pella86/Schrodinger-religion/blob/master/other-religions/Religions%20and%20old%20texts.md)

Example:
There are verses in the Qu'ran that mention the beauty and usefulness of the animals, and even defining happiness (16:9, 81:5, 36:41-42, 3:14).

Many modern interpretations associate those verses with the need of new and faster locomotion mediums [1], the need of having a car, and in some places the prohibition for woman to drive. 
The horse is compared effectively in many occasions as a car, motorcycle or even bike, the similitude can be true, yet we need to take the dangerous path of arbitrary interpretations.

The fundamental problem here is to try to fit the modern society way of communications and motility into an animal that is not anymore used as transport system.
Not only the similitude is weak, but doesn't include other paradigms of transportation, like public transport or robotic cars.
I'm not trying to undermine religious erudites but I would like to argue that rewriting the text to support new concepts is the way we should proceed. 
Maybe consider a complete new text that will give a better stance on transportation other the one on the back of an animal.
I took the Qu'ran as an example also because the Saudi Arabia prohibiton of women to drive.

Although they are updated continuously by the work of the religious leaders, this reinterpretation creates a fragmented ad hoc religion which doesn't reflect the original branch.
The dissonance in the example is clear, even inside the muslim countries there's fundamental interepretations that favors one or the other verse.

## How is the new religion different
I want to create a modern religion, written socially by people, which can be a group or even be written anonymously.
I want to introduce the concept that is not important who wrote it, but the content of what is written.
I want to create a dynamic sacred script that is modified with the discovery of new technologies.
I don't want to completely refuse the old and sacred texts, because I'm sure they contain deep fundamentals of the human nature (e.g. revenge, anger and other emotions and its handlings.
I want population contribution towards writing a text that is for humans, written by humans.

To tell the truth: Well I'm not sure where this idea might bring.
I just shot the flat stone on the lake.
But I don't know how many bounces it will make and if it even will reach the other side.
What I would like to make is really a comprehensive social media mediated religion that will maybe and possibily find the communication with the existing branches of religions.
Of course wants to bring in typical religion stuff, like rites and traditions, if they absorbed by the regional traditions or if they are completely invented from scratch we will see.
For now I'd like opinions and contributions.

## The new religion
I would like to build a OpenSource religion and I intend to use GitHub as a medium to write the sacred text.
GitHub offers the possibility to create a repository (a collection of texts) where the people can positively interact with them.

### Contributing to the religion
A person that wants to contribute to the religion can simply fork this repository and write his stances.
(Can be that the person decide to delete or add things, even rewrite it from scratch)
Technically the person who forked this repository is making his own religion on a new living branch.
The person can in future decide to mix his thoughts with the mine and will ask me to fuse them, after a review process the modification might be implemented.

### Following the religion
If you want to follow the budding Schrodiger religion (Pella86 branch) you can and you simply have to follow what is written on the text.

## The purpose of the Schrodinger religion
This religion is meant to be a way of achieving coexistence in the human species and to promote progress.
We will later define what is meant by progress and coexistence in more detail, but both terms should be taken in the literal form.
Progress[1]: Development towards an improved or more advanced condition.
Coexistence[2]: he state or condition of living in harmony despite different ideologies or interests.

## Manifest of the Schrodinger religion
There are some examples of religions born in this century that came to have a big public reception, mostly negative (Scientology  [1], LaVey Satanism [2]).
I want to go toward a secular Humanist vision [3], base the morality on science and philosophy, although I don't want to deny faith.
Many concepts of our life have to be based on some form of belief, with the huge ammount of modern information we can't possibly test, read or revising everything, thus here comes in my opinion in play faith.
There is an other argument for including faith or religious behavior, I strongly believe that some humans do need a deity or a supernatural being in their lives.
(I personally don't but other might)
The culture of individualism and the culture of human instincts is very good, if it is used to facilitate the interaction with other humans. 
The secular Humanism does in principle call for strong rationality, but not all humans have the same degree of rationality, thus feelings must be taken in consideration.
An anthropocentric view of the religion itself is a basic in the new religion, albeit the human to desire for a deity or collective consciousness.
These feelings must be considered when creating this dual religion.

## Why don't we consider a Schrödinger religion?  
Schrödinger religion, will consider the hypothesis that atheism AND theism both exist at the same time.
The existence of the presence of a god discussion is mathematically proven to be a non-answerable question,
since neither side as far as of now can provide proof to the existence or the nonexistence. (source, Gödel and Sobel).
*(Gödel and Aquin define the principle of faith in God but aren't proof of it. Sobel critizises those principles.*
*Depending on the branch of philosophy there's ways to demontrate god presence. Just mathematics can't prove it.)*
Although it is a human need to believe in a super being, an order of things, a god or gods so to speak.
More than 80% of the population believes or is unsure about the presence of a god. [1]
This reflects a basic human need to cope with the apparent void meaning of life. Now God, or a super natural being
is a human mental construct. It is something the brain creates, something humans conceive and worship.
Now how can we make a religion that will encompass both ends? Perhaps a Schrödinger religion?
A religion that both considers the existence and nonexistence of deities.
