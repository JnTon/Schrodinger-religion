#Introduction
This section is about what the human mind and society perceive as ink on the body. 
I will also talk about piercings as they've been used by the gay community as a tag or a symbol to be different.
Should we accept all of society's body modifications? What about split tongues and  plastic implants to mimic the appearance of horns?

##Piercings in general  

Piercings have become widely spread and generally accepted in society. The piercings I am referring to are any metal/plastic object in sites different than the standard lower ear lobe. Although this paragraph is a general description. kindsThere are many kinds of piercings, ranging from a simple nose piercing, a septum piercing or even a dimple piercing. The earring is more accepted, while a septum piercing is not. Already this difference is kind of strange. So at what point is a piercing consider overdone and no longer acceptable to society?

Piercings were once used as an element of recognition. For example, the value of the earring was used in determining which social
class you would belong. With the expanding medical health facilities, wilder piercing became possible.
Piercings can cause infections and even death if the infection is left untreated.
However, with the new techniques in medicine, one can explore piercings in other part of the body.
Not just on the head, but all over the body. Male piercings are still less acccepted today, although an earring or an eyebrow piercing can increase the sex appeal of the person. In the seventies, the piercing was used as a way to distinguish potential homosexual partners from heterosexual men. For example, a piercing, like Elton John, on the right ear lobe shows the alternative sexual orientation.

A piercing can be used also sexually. Genital piercings are used to increase orgasms. 
This is not limited to only penis piercing, but also vaginal or nipples piercings. Sexual play with piercing should be more exciting. 
I'm personally completely in favor to this modifications. If somebody would disagree, I'd love to hear the motivations.

##The tongue piercing

Tongue piercings, fairly easy to hide, can also be sexy and discrete. Is a tongue piercing attractive? What exactly is attractiveness
in our society? How do we measure it? Is the piercing sexy because it is hidden? Does the piercing help with stimulation in oral sexual activities? 
Answering these questions is critical to understand the piercing and its place in our society.
The piercing itself is attractive for some people, but others will find it unattractive. The piercing's invisibility while speaking normally
might help those who dislike this piercing to be more willing to accept it.

##The stretching

Piercings that dilate the wound to form a larger implant are also called gauge piercing. The stretching can be acceptable,
but many forms of it are regarded as unappealing to the rest of society. They are used in some tribal African cultures as a means of distinguishing status within the tribe.
How do we decide as a society what is acceptable in an absolute matter? The girl in this picture has her ears stretched although
she appears as not only acceptable to society, but also attractive. This type of piercing is generally socially acceptable.
If a group of people can accept this type of body modification without problems, can the rest of society?
Where do we trace the threshold? How do we define acceptability?

Moreover there's piercings that are done in order to shock people and to show some kind of rebellion to the society standard.
This kind of piercing is difficult to integrate in an acceptable context. 

Somehow ears stretching piercing are better visually than some other piercings. This probably has some strong cultural influence.
So how do we define a socially acceptable law that will determine which piercings are good or not and in which cases?
