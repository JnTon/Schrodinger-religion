# Love
This file will try to define love, and what we should as humans follow to have a healthy feeling.
Some sort of guidelines that will try to untangle the feeling itself.
 
##### Summary
Love is a positive feeling, and must be intended and professed in this way.

## Definition of love
Love is a mixture of feelings and sensations that human feels toward a person, a object or an ideology.

Love is a positive feeling of human nature of varying strength. 
This little snipplet should guide us in maintaining love as a positive feeling.
Love is seen as a passion, and the general feeling of being able to do anything toward the loved entity.
We can see love as an extreme form of altruism, were in some cases the cost outweight the benefits by much.


### Unconditional love
Unconditional love is fundamentally wrong if is intended toward one person or a restricted group of people.
Unconditional love is dangerous because it doesn't allow people to change their mind upon change of the entity loved.
Dynamism is a very good quality of humanity and we must keep it solid.

### Romantic love
I will concentrate now on describing the love between people that wants to share life together in a relationship.
I am very strict in the definition of love, the feeling must come from both sides. 
To borrow some math languge love is only defined if there's a bijective correlation between the people involved.
I would also say surjectivity is fine,  since it's possible that one is "more" in love with the other.
Yet one of the fundamentals must be that the love is reciprocate.

The feeling we have for one person when we are in love, but the other person doesn't cosider us as object of love needs to be redefined with: crush or obsession.

By setting this non individual form of love many categories of love fall behind.
Example: the love a 13 yo has for Bieber, the love we have for someone who doesn't know us, or the romantic love toward a friend

This can now set the development of relationship and love in a more comprehensive way.
