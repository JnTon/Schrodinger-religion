#Yoism
Yoism is a Open Source religion like this one.
The same principles of societal contribuition and review are compelled.
Yet the religion itself looks like a Wikipedia, even if the contributors don't want to use the system.

Many opinions will confluence in one single religion.
Yet the Schr√∂dinger religion will aim to have separate religion for each one of his members, and if at the end a common ground is found better so.

## The Yo:
For example in your proof of Yo. You assert that:
"This unseen world manifests as the collective, human, experiential world in a lawful, stable, and consistent manner that, as our knowledge advances, is increasingly predictable, is independent of any individual's wishes and biases, and outlasts our deaths or lapses in consciousness."

This is a fantastic description of reality since is collective and human, something that wants to be central also in my religion.
The comment continues proving by induction that something like a objective reality exists and obey the laws that we discover, that we call natural laws.

The religion proceed in calling that medium that were we arise and our consciousness and psyche tries to interpret is called Yo.

I'd have something to add, even if it was the other way around that our mind will create reality and thereby make myself, the entire universe and thus Yo, it wouldn't really matter, because the focus of our existence must not be on the Yo, but on what you wrote in your first page, which is the care of what is around and perceived to us.
