#Yoism
Yoism is an Open Source religion like this one.
The same principles of societal contribuitions and reviews are compelled.
Yet the religion itself looks like a Wikipedia, even if the contributors don't want to use the system.

Many opinions will confluence into one single religion.
In comparison, the Schr√∂dinger religion will aim to have separate religions for each one of his members and if at the end a common ground is found better so be it.

## The Yo:
For example in your proof of Yo. You assert that:
"This unseen world manifests as the collective, human, experiential world in a lawful, stable, and consistent manner that, as our knowledge advances, is increasingly predictable, is independent of any individual's wishes and biases, and outlasts our deaths or lapses in consciousness."

This is a fantastic description of reality since is collective and human; something that is central also in my religion.
The comment continues proving by induction that something like a objective reality exists and obeys the laws that we discover, those which we call natural laws.

The religion proceeds in calling that medium, from which we arise and what our consciousness and psyche tries to interpret, Yo.

I'd have something to add, that even if it was the other way around where our mind creates reality and therefore makes myself, the entire universe, and thus Yo; it wouldn't really matter, because the focus of our existence must not be on the Yo, but on what you wrote on your first page, which is the care of what is around and perceived to us.
