The main religions right now are based on old texts. Christianity has the biblical canon, namely the New and Old Testament,
Islam has the Qua'ran, Hinduism has Vedas and the Upanishads, although defining these texts as fundamental of Hinduism is incomplete
due to the diverse traditions of the religion. Buddhist, much like Hinduism has a variety of texts that for some are considered as
sacred, and for others, not sacred. All in all these texts are written in antiquity and don't take in account the fast pace of
progression that society, over recent times, has undergone.

Modern religions try to adapt to this new era by means of reinterpreting the same scripts,
but by doing this they are committing a huge fallacy by reusing the old religious conception to try to fit them in the newer concepts.
This is also the reason of the decay of faith in the new century (Unproved statement). The new and wild reinterpretations create paradoxes
and splits each religion into subgroups. Although they are updated continuously by the work of the religious leaders,
this reinterpretation creates a fragmented ad hoc religion which doesn't reflect the original branch.
This causes the identity of a religion to fragments in many subgroups.  Christianity is divided in three main groups:
Roman Catholicism, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox. Muslims seem to convey that faith is more unitary and they recognize
themselves as part of something called ummah, which contains all the faucets of faith. Despite this unity,
there are subgroups like the Sunni and Shi'a, but also spawning from this religion are Wahhabi Islam or Nation of Islam.
Howard R. Greenstein takes the words of  Leo Trepp and identified six subgroups in Judaism. I'm sure that also the other major religions in the world have such fragmentation [1]. Hinduism and Buddhism are already a convolution of many traditions and rites[2].
